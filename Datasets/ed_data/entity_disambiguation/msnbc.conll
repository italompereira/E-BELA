later
told

I
mean

travel

was
stripped

shoes

jacket

prescribed
heart
medicine

locked

feared

return

I
used

be
happy

now

ca
n't
wait

not

Stocks
finished
an
erratic
session
mixed
Tuesday
as

lifted
energy

shares
.

had
their

Stocks
had
zigzagged
for
much
of
the
day
on
mixed
news
from
retailers
and
industrial
production
.

A
rebound
in
the
dollar
after
three
down
days
kept
investors
'
appetite
for
stocks
in
check
.

An
eight-month
weakening
of

lifting

prices

shares

exporters
,
which
benefit
from
stronger
foreign
demand
for
their
goods
when
the

falls
.

Record-low
U.S.
interest
rates
have
also
driven
investors
to
seek
higher
returns
in
stocks
and
commodities
,
lifting
share
prices
.

Trading
volume
remained
light
,
signaling
a
lack
of
strong
conviction
behind
the

.

Investors
focused

of

biggest
worries
:
how
much

But
the
public
discussion
about

became
a
distraction

In
the
lurch

Children
with
health
insurance
are
usually
taken
to
the
doctor
at
the
first
sign
of
illness
,
while
parents
of
uninsured
kids
often
wait
because
they
are
conscious
of
the
cost
.

Then
the
child
's
illness
can
worsen
and
the
parent
is
forced
to
miss
work
to
nurse
the
child
back
to
health
.

In
Alabama	B	Alabama	Alabama	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama	000	000
,
there
were
230,000
uninsured
children
in
1988
,
and
that
has
fallen
to
around
70,000
due
to
a
combination
of
the
Child
Caring
Foundation
and
state
programs
.

Jody
Sharp
,
60
,
is
an
example
of
the
problem
the
charity
aims
to
address
.

She
and
her
husband
adopted
a
foster
child
,
Dana
,
from
a
mother
who
was
mentally
handicapped
.

Later
,
they
adopted
Dana
's
brother
Kyle
who
has
epilepsy
and
asthma
.

But
Sharp
's
husband
,
the
family
wage
earner
,
walked
out
in
1990
,
leaving
Sharp
to
bring
up
the
two
children
with
no
health
insurance
.
"

If
you
never
had
a
child
with
epilepsy
,
you
would
never
know
how
many
bills
you
can
incur
.

With
no
insurance
,
it
's
thousands
of
dollars
just
like
that
,

Sharp

children
received
free
medical

and
she
found

.

The
money
saved
helped
her
move
into

Some
90
percent
of
the
55,000
children
on
the
program
move
into
private
health
insurance
within
about
30
months
.
"

All
of
us
have
times
when
we
lose
jobs

lose

You
need

you

By

,
144,000

were
in

There
was
a
crisis
.

And
the
whole
thing
came
about
as
an
answer
for
how
health
insurance
should
work
,
"
said
spokesperson
Denise
Grabner
of
Highmark	B	Highmark	Highmark	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highmark	000	000
.

In
1997
,
the
program
expanded
to
include
children
of
the
working
poor
when
Congress	B	Congress	United_States_Congress	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress	000	000
enacted
the
SCHIP	B	SCHIP	State_Children's_Health_Insurance_Program	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Children's_Health_Insurance_Program	000	000
providing
some
matching
funding
.

Alabama	B	Alabama	Alabama	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama	000	000
was
the
first
of
20
states
to
participate
,
creating
the
All
Kids
program
,
with
money
from
state
settlement
with
tobacco
companies
.

The
program
provides
insurance
for
children
above
the
level
at
which
they
would
qualify
for
Medicaid	B	Medicaid	Medicaid	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid	000	000
.

Many
states
now
provide
insurance
for
families
who
earn
up
to
double
the
poverty
rate
,
defined
as
$
10,000
a
year
for
a
single
person
and
$
20,000
for
a
family
of
four
.

But
Rohling
said
an
individual
needed
to
earn
nearly
three
times
the
poverty
level
to
afford
private
insurance
.

Among
the
rovers
'
new
skills
is
the
ability
to
automatically
recognize
and
transmit
to
Earth	B	Earth	Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth	000	000
photographs
that
they
take
of
swirling
dust
devils
or
floating
clouds
.

They
can
also
independently
decide
whether
it
is
safe
to
extend
its
robotic
arm
to
sample
a
piece
of
rock
.

Before
,
scientists
had
to
painstakingly
dissect
thousands
of
images
just
to
find
the
frames
they
need
and
decide
for
the
rovers
whether
to
use
their
arms
.

The
high-tech
upgrades
should
help
save
time
--
as
much
as
a
day
because
scientists
on
Earth	B	Earth	Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth	000	000
do
n't
have
to
study
a
rock
before
sending
commands
to
the
robot
to
pick
it
up
.

If
successful
,
the
changes
could
get
incorporated
into
future
Mars	B	Mars	Mars	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars	000	000
missions
.

Spirit	B	Spirit	Spirit_(rover)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_(rover)	000	000
and
Opportunity	B	Opportunity	Opportunity_(rover)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_(rover)	000	000
were
also
fitted
with
a
new
navigation
system
that
allows
them
to
think
several
steps
ahead
when
faced
with
an
obstacle
,
allowing
them
to
back
out
of
a
dead
end
or
even
navigate
a
maze
on
their
own
,
Callas
said
.

The
geologic
robots
have
previously
tackled
one
problem
at
a
time
.

Entering
their
fourth
year
of
exploration
,
both
golf
cart-sized
vehicles
have
long
outlasted
their
missions
,
originally
planned
for
about
three
months
.

While
scientists
are
impressed
by
the
rovers
'
longevity
,
they
admit
the
robots
could
die
at
any
time
.

The
rovers
'
biggest
accomplishment
is
uncovering
geologic
evidence
that
water
once
flowed
on
Mars	B	Mars	Mars	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars	000	000
.

One
year

Tuesday
,
the
nation
was
holding
its
breath
for
13

began

Virginia	I	West Virginia	West_Virginia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia	000	000
and
the
federal
government
have
passed
new
mine
safety
laws
.

But
in
the
mines
themselves
,
little
has
changed
.

•
There
's
still
no
better
way
to
communicate
with
miners
below
ground
;

•
Wireless
communications
wo
n't
be
required
until
2009
;

•
Electronic
tracking
systems
for
miners
are
still
on
the
drawing
board
;

•
Underground
emergency
safe
rooms
are
still
not
required
by
law
;
and

•
Mines
have
another
year
to
position
more
rescue
teams
.

We
need
to
have
a
way
to
communicate
with
trapped
miners
,
"
McAteer
says
.
"

We
need
to
protect
trapped
miners
until
we
can
get
to
them
,
and
we
need
to
have
a
way
that
we

What
has
changed
in
mine
safety
since
the
Sago	B	Sago	Sago_Mine_disaster	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sago_Mine_disaster	000	000
tragedy
:

•
Improved
emergency
procedures
and
training
is
now
required
;

•
There
are
more
federal
mine
inspectors
and
tougher
fines
for
safety
violations
;
and

•
Mines
must
now
notify
the
federal
government
within
15
minutes
of
an
accident
.

Still
not
required
,
though
are
underground
emergency
safe
rooms
.

The
union
representing
many
of
the
nation
's
73,000
coal
miners
says
it
's
a
sign
of
priorities
.
"

There
's
still
just
an
attitude
out
there
that
production
comes
first
and
safety
is
a
convenient
thing
and
it
comes
second
,

producing
a
record
1.17
billion
tons
of
coal
in

also
the
highest

that
since

terrorist

agencies
have
tried
to
overcome
old
turf
rivalries
that
can
hamper
emergency
work
.
"

In

not
all
,
there
are
some
longstanding
cultural
differences

Chertoff	B	Chertoff	Michael_Chertoff	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chertoff	000	000
said

"

I
think
that
is
a
challenge
and
that
culture
has
been
a
challenge
.
"

The
report
found
that
while
emergency
agencies
in
more
than
60
percent
of
the
communities
studied
had
the
ability
to
talk
to
each
other
during
a

,
only
21

"
the

an
overview

the

all

have
policies
in

But
it
also
finds
that

)
across

has
lagged
.

The
attacks
of
Sept.
11
,
2001
,
revealed
major
problems
in
how
well
emergency
agencies
were
able
to
talk
to
each
other
during
a

Judged
in
three
categories

Communities
were
judged
in
three
categories
:
operating
procedures
in
place
,
use
of
communications
systems
and
how
effectively
local
governments
have
coordinated
in
preparation
for
a
disaster
.

Most
of
the
areas
surveyed
included
cities
and
their
surrounding
communities
,
based
on
the
assumption
that
in
a
major
crisis
emergency
personnel
from
all
local
jurisdictions
would
respond
.

The
areas
with
the
six
best
scores
were
judged
advanced
in
all
three
categories
.

The
cities
with
the
lowest
grades
had
reached
the
early
implementation
stage
for
only
one
category
,
and
intermediate
grades
in
the
other
two
categories
.

What
we
'll
want
in
a
president

How
will
American
voters
compensate
in
the
2008
election
?

WASHINGTON	B	WASHINGTON	Washington,_D.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.	000	000
-
Now
that
the
38th
president
has
been
laid
to
rest
,
the
capital
can
take
up
the
main
business
of
2007
:
trying
to
figure
out
who
will
be
the
44th
.

What
type
of
leader
does
the
country
want
?

Here
is
my
sense
of
it
,
based
on
talking
to
politicians
,
strategists
and
voters
here
and
around
the
nation
.

No
ideologues
,
please

There
was
a
time
when
President	B	President George W. Bush	George_W._Bush	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush	000	000
George	I	President George W. Bush	George_W._Bush	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush	000	000
W.	I	President George W. Bush	George_W._Bush	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush	000	000
Bush	I	President George W. Bush	George_W._Bush	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush	000	000
's
ideological
certitude
was
politically
appealing
and
perhaps
functionally
necessary
.

That
time
has
long
since
passed
.

The
country
is
tired
,
even
fearful
,
of
leaders
with
fervent
beliefs
that
seem
impervious
to
new
(
or
even
old
)
facts
.

Voters
see
the
war
in
Iraq	B	Iraq	Iraq	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq	000	000
as
an
"
idea
,
"
not
a
solution
--
and
Americans
do
not
like
ideas
that
do
not
work
.

Voters
likely
will
view
Bush	B	Bush	George_W._Bush	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush	000	000
's
"
surge
"
of
troops
into
Iraq	B	Iraq	Iraq	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq	000	000
as
new
evidence
of
failure
,
and
the
dangers
of
a
leader
who
depends
on
preconceived
ideas
.

Serious
student

Presidential
elections
are
a
never-ending
series
of
mid-course
corrections
.

Voters
look
to
compensate
for
the
leadership
weaknesses
of
the
incumbent
.

An
example
comes
from
the
life
and
career
of
Gerald	B	Gerald Ford	Gerald_Ford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford	000	000
Ford	I	Gerald Ford	Gerald_Ford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford	000	000
.

In
1976
,
voters
wanted
a
pure
antidote
to
Richard	B	Richard Nixon	Richard_Nixon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon	000	000
Nixon	I	Richard Nixon	Richard_Nixon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon	000	000
's
paranoid
megalomania
.

Once
Ford	B	Ford	Gerald_Ford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford	000	000
pardoned
Nixon	B	Nixon	Richard_Nixon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon	000	000
,
he
could
not
be
that
candidate
.

Instead
,
Americans
chose
Jimmy	B	Jimmy Carter	Jimmy_Carter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter	000	000
Carter	I	Jimmy Carter	Jimmy_Carter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter	000	000
,
a
peanut
farmer
who
had
never
worked
in
Washington	B	Washington	Washington,_D.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.	000	000
,
and
who
promised
never
to
lie
to
the
American	B	American people	Americans	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans	000	000
people	I	American people	Americans	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans	000	000
.

The
counterpoint
thinking
continues
.

Voters
in
2008
are
going
to
want
someone
who
prides
himself
(
or
herself
)
on
spending
time
in
the
library
--
who
has
a
hands-on
curiosity
about
the
details
.

Washington	B	Washington	Washington,_D.c.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.c.	000	000
experience
not
necessary

Voters
these
days
not
only
do
not
value
Washington	B	Washington	Washington,_D.c.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.c.	000	000
experience
--
or
any
office-holding
experience
--
it
can
make
them
suspicious
.

That
is
what
strategists
and
polltakers
for
Sen.
Evan	B	Evan Bayh	Evan_Bayh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh	000	000
Bayh	I	Evan Bayh	Evan_Bayh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh	000	000
found
when
they
studied
whether
he
should
run
for
president
.

They
found
that
his
remarkably
deep
resume
--
the
son
of
a
senator
,
he
was
the
"
boy
governor
"
of
Indiana	B	Indiana	Indiana	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana	000	000
before
going
to
the
Senate	B	Senate	United_States_Senate	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate	000	000
--
was
as
handicap
.

Americans
always
are
dubious
about
the
capital
,
but
that
sentiment
seems
particularly
strong
.

Bayh	B	Bayh	Evan_Bayh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh	000	000
decided
not
to
run
.
"

`
Washington	B	Washington	Washington,_D.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.	000	000
'
does
n't
make
the
case

,
who
worked
for
Bayh	B	Bayh	Evan_Bayh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Bayh	000	000
.

No
more
boomer
obsessions

Not
all
elections
are
about
change
,
but
2008
will
be
.

Americans
are
moderately
upbeat
about
the
country
's
prospects
,
but
deeply
worried
about
the
world
--
and
they
have
come
to
realize
that
they
ca
n't
separate
one
from
the
other
.

One
thing
for
sure
,
says
Pfeiffer	B	Pfeiffer	Daniel_Pfeiffer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pfeiffer	000	000
,
voters
are
tired
of
arguing
about
the
culture
of
the
1960s
and
other
Boomer
issues
.
"

There
is
a
sense
that
the
2004
election
was
too
much
about
who
did
or
did
not
do
what
in

Bushes
have
a
congenital
family
problem
with
this

and
it
leaves
an
opening
for
someone
--
of
either
party

can
prove
that
he

really
understands
the
strains
of
middle

It

not
just
about
money
,

about
cultural
assaults
and
the
lack

time
for

Resolution
to
imbibe
less
goes
awry
--
already

Myriad
of
conflicting
medical
studies
are
enough
to
drive
this
writer
to
drink

The
fruitcake
's
been
digested
,
the
gift
cards
are
empty
,
and
now
it
's
time
to
face
the
most
grueling
holiday
task
of
all
:
the
annual
reassessment
.

Do
I
need
to
exercise
more
?

Spend
less
?

Set
aside
more
quality
time
for
friends
and
family
?

The
resolution
list
goes
on
and
on
--
much
like
that
interminable
karaoke
version
of
"
Santa	B	Santa Baby	Santa_Baby	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Baby	000	000
Baby	I	Santa Baby	Santa_Baby	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Baby	000	000
"
at
this
year
's
holiday
party
.

Unfortunately
,
since
I
was
the
one
holding
the
microphone
,
this
year
's
resolution
seems
painfully
clear
:
Cut
back
on
the
alcohol
intake
.

Not
that
I
drink
a
lot
--
usually
just
a
glass
of
wine
with
dinner
,
if
that
but
I
've
read
that
even
one
drink
a
day
can
adversely
affect
my
health
.

Also
,
a
recent
study
by
the
Mayo	B	Mayo Clinic	Mayo_Clinic	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic	000	000
Clinic	I	Mayo Clinic	Mayo_Clinic	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic	000	000
found
that
women
's
bodies
are
less
adept
at
breaking
down
alcohol
than
men
's
.

As
a
result
,
the
more
we
drink
,
the
more
we
risk
heart
disease
,
cancer
,
cirrhosis
of
the
liver
,
and
,
perhaps
the
most
chilling
side
effect
of
all
--
kissing
our
skinny
jeans
goodbye
forever
.

But
how
much
alcohol
is
too
much
?

There
's
the
rub
.

The
answer
seems
to
depend
on
which
study
you
read
.

The
Mayo	B	Mayo Clinic	Mayo_Clinic	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic	000	000
Clinic	I	Mayo Clinic	Mayo_Clinic	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic	000	000
study
says
one
drink
a
day
is
OK
for
"
younger
women
who
are
n't
planning
a
pregnancy
"
and
that
"
postmenopausal
women
should
limit
themselves
to
less
.
"

But
what
about
those
of
us
who
do
n't
fit
in
either
category
?

Looking
for
a
definitive
answer
,
I
turned
to
another
study
,
this
one
conducted
by
a
group
of
doctors
at
Stony	B	Stony Brook University	Stony_Brook_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Brook_University	000	000
Brook	I	Stony Brook University	Stony_Brook_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Brook_University	000	000
University	I	Stony Brook University	Stony_Brook_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Brook_University	000	000
in
New	B	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
York	I	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
.

But
their
finding
that
drinking
three
glasses
of
red
wine
a
week
reduces
the
risk
of
colorectal
cancer
only
confused
matters
further
.

Who
to
believe
?

Should
I
cut
back
on
alcohol
entirely
in
order
to
fend
off
heart
disease
,
liver
problems
and
dreaded
weight
gain
(
not
to
mention
potential
blackmail
opportunities
by
family
,
friends
and
co-workers
)
or
suck
down
three
or
more
glasses
a
week
to
keep
the
colorectal
cancer
at
bay
?

Or
should
I
listen
to
the
doctors
the
Goteborg	B	Goteborg University	University_of_Gothenburg	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Gothenburg	000	000
University	I	Goteborg University	University_of_Gothenburg	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Gothenburg	000	000
in
Sweden	B	Sweden	Sweden	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden	000	000
,
who
found
that
mice
that
had
ingested
low
levels
of
alcohol
on
a
daily
basis
showed
a
significantly
lower
risk
of
developing
rheumatoid
arthritis
than
mice
that
just
drank
water
.

Obsessed
,
I
started
digging
through
medical
journals
and
online
health
stories
until
the
studies
began
to
stack
up
like
swizzle
sticks
at
a
company-hosted
bar
.

In
London	B	London	London	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London	000	000
,
researchers
found
that
people
who
drank
alcohol
have
a
lower
risk
of
developing
non

lymphoma	I	Hodgkin 's lymphoma	Hodgkin's_lymphoma	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgkin's_lymphoma	000	000
,
but
the
risk
of
cancer
of
the
mouth
,
esophagus
and
liver
actually
increases
.

At
Ohio	B	Ohio State University	Ohio_State_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University	000	000
State	I	Ohio State University	Ohio_State_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University	000	000
University	I	Ohio State University	Ohio_State_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_University	000	000
,
a
study
showed
that
drinking
moderately
(
such
as
a
couple
of
drinks
a
day
)
improved
the
memories
of
laboratory
rats
,
although
a
study
at
the
University	B	University of Missouri	University_of_Missouri	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Missouri	000	000
of	I	University of Missouri	University_of_Missouri	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Missouri	000	000
Missouri	I	University of Missouri	University_of_Missouri	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Missouri	000	000
declared
that
alcohol
hindered
academic
success
.

Live
longer
so
you
can
die
young

Adding
it
all
up
,
it
seems
that
by
drinking
alcohol
I
can
both
reduce
my
chances
of
heart
disease
and
increase
my
risk
for
high
blood
pressure
,
fend
off
dementia
while
upping
my
chances
for
brain
damage
,
boost
my
memory
at
the
same
time
that
I
become
more
stupid
,
avoid
lymphoma
while
veering
towards
breast
and
liver
cancer
,
and
in
general
,
both
live
longer
and
die
younger
.

In
other
words
,
alcohol
is
every
bit
the
hazy
hypocritical
demon
it
's
always
been
(
especially
when
there
's
a
microphone
involved
)
.

So
this
year
,
I
'm
taking
another
resolution
route
altogether
.

Instead
of
squelching
my
alcohol
intake
,
I
'm
going
to
cut
out
karaoke
--
and
perhaps
limit
my
medical
studies
to
just
one
per
day
with
dinner
,
if
that
.

help
the
body
fight
many
serious
conditions
,
including
cancer
and
heart
disease
,
by
thwarting
the
action
of
harmful
free
radicals
.

Incorporate
whole
grains

2007
is
the
year
to
stop
buying
refined
,
white
starch
.

Instead
,
embrace
brown
rice
,
whole
wheat
pasta
,
whole
grain
bread
and
other
healthy
grain
varieties
like
millet
,
faro
,
and
amaranth
.

Learn
how
to
buy
the
right
bread
!

Many
consumers
believe
they
're
buying
the
right
type
of
bread
but
are
often
confused
.

According
to
a
Sara
Lee
Food
&
Beverage
survey
,
73
%
of
consumers
who
were
asked
what
type
of
bread
they
had
in
the
house
said
"
whole
wheat
bread
,
"
but
after
checking
the
label
realized
that
they
mistakenly
thought
"
enriched
wheat
"
meant
whole
grain
.

Look
a
"
whole
"
lot
closer
at
labels
in
the
bread
aisle
-

Slow
the
pace
-
lose
fat
on
your
waist

In
an
interesting
experiment
that
was
presented
at
the
2006
Annual
Scientific
Meeting
a
NAASO
,
women
were
invited
to
eat
a
pasta
lunch
on
two
different
days
.

On
one
day
,
the
women
were
given
a
small
spoon
and
asked
to
take
small
bites
,
put
the
spoon
down
between
bites
,
and
chew
each
bite
at
least
15
times
.

On
the
second
day
,
the
women
were
given
a
large
spoon
and
asked
to
eat
as
quickly
as
possible
without
stopping
between
bites
.

On
both
occasions
,
the
women
ate
until
they
felt
comfortably
full
.

When
researchers
measured
how
many
calories
the
women
ate
,
they
found
that
women
ate
67
more
calories
when
they
ate
quickly
than
when
they
ate
slowly
.

Although
this
may
not
sound
like
much
,
calories
add
up
.

An
additional
134
calories
per
day
,
means
48,910
calories
per
year
...
.

that
's
potentially
14
pounds
(
lost
or
gained
!
)
