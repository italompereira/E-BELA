between
senior

But
the

gave
no
further
details
and
al-Najafi
,
who
left
Baghdad
on

,
declined

comment
.

Al-Najafi
arrived

with
a

thousands
of
Iranian
POWs
Tehran	B	Tehran	Tehran	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran	000	000
claims
are
still
held

Iraq
has
long
maintained
that
it
has
released
all
Iranian
prisoners
and
was
reportedly
angered
by
the
new
list
.

In
April
,
Iran
released
5,584
Iraqi
POWs
and
Iraq
freed
three
POWs
and
316

it
classified

of
plans
to
build
the
plant
,
to
be
called
HydroKraft
,
pending
approval
by
government
agencies
.

The
company
said
if
it
receives
the
proper
approvals
in
1999
,
construction
of
the
plant
would
be
completed
during
2002
and
production

would
occur
in

Earlier
this
year
,
the
company
announced
a
new
technology
that
would
allow
it
to
use
clean-burning
hydrogen
to
generate
electricity
.

The
hydrogen
for
the
plant
would
be
extracted

a

would
be
90
percent
lower
than

using
natural
gas
.

Norway	B	Norway	Norway	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway	000	000
is
the
world
's
second-largest
oil
exporter
,
and
also
produces
vast
amounts
of
natural
gas
from
its
offshore
fields
.

Virtually
all

also
be
able

he
said

The
airline

said
they

Deutsche

chief
Johannes
Ludewig
said
his
railway
also
would
work
to
coordinate
schedules
better
with

flights
to
make

,
and
allow
for

on

,
a

told

that
Asahara
was
still

at

Inoue
quoted
Asahara
as
saying
that
he

be

.

Last
month
,
the
Truth
Comission
issued
a
landmark
report
on
its
findings

It
said
Botha

bombing
of
a
Johannesburg	B	Johannesburg	Johannesburg	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg	000	000
building
housing
an
anti-apartheid
group
.

When
Botha
was
head
of
state
in
the
1980s
,
thousands
of
people
were
detained
without
trial
.

Many
were
tortured
and
others
killed
.

The
commission
can
grant

to
those
who
fully
confess
to
politically
motivated
abuses
committed
during
apartheid
.

Botha
has
said
he
has
nothing
to
confess
and
has
not
sought
amnesty
.

Earlier
this
year
,
Botha
was
convicted
of
contempt	B	contempt of court	Contempt_of_court	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court	000	000

as
the

--
(
there
are
presently
more
than
100
radio
surgery
centres
around
the
world
)
.

Radio
surgery
is
a
modern
technique
which
does
n't
require
surgery
in
order
to
remove
cancerous	B	cancerous	Cancer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer	000	000
growth
or
tissues	B	tissues	Tissue_(biology)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)	000	000
.

It
involves
a
three	B	three dimensional	Three-dimensional_space	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space	000	000
dimensional	I	three dimensional	Three-dimensional_space	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space	000	000

Surgery	I	Stereotaxic Surgery	Stereotactic_surgery	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotactic_surgery	000	000
,
which
is
also
used
in
conjunction
with
radiation	B	radiation	Radiation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation	000	000
equipment
known
as
the
Linear	B	Linear Accelerator	Linear_particle_accelerator	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator	000	000
Accelerator	I	Linear Accelerator	Linear_particle_accelerator	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator	000	000
.

With
this
new
technology
,
doctors
are
able
to
removal
cancerous
tissues
embedded
deep
inside
the
brain
or
near
sensitive
organs
that
makes
normal
surgery
very
difficult
and
risky
.

With
radio
surgery
,
every
step
is
controlled
by
computers
and
patients
are
conscious	B	conscious	Consciousness	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness	000	000
while
they
undergo
treatment
.

This
new
technique
is
also
capable
of
treating
diseases
such
as
Artero
Venous
Malformation	B	Malformation	Congenital_disorder	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_disorder	000	000
(
the

of
veins
or
blood
capillaries	B	capillaries	Capillary	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary	000	000
in
the
brain
)
.

So
far
,
ninety
per
cent
of
the
radio
surgery
treatments
have
been
successful
and
patients
only
have
to
remain
in
hospital
for
three
days
.

Additionally
,
there
is
no
need
for
patients
to
shave
their
heads
and
radio
surgery
causes
no
scar
,
little
blood
loss
and
is
not
expensive.For
