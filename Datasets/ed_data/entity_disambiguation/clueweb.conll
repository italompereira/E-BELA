This
September
1999
help
sheet
gives
information

Text
files
and
non-text
files
.

File
formats
.

Methods
to
input
data
from
a
range
of
sources

an
existing
Worksheet

or

workbook

Saving
files

It
can
be
surprisingly
difficult
to
input
data
from

sources
other
than

an
Excel
workbook
from
versions
of
Excel
the
same
as
or
earlier
than

the

version
you
are
using
.

TEXT
FILES
AND
NON-TEXT
FILES

There
are
many
ways
to
represent
data
on
a
computer
.

The
essential

divide
is
between
text
files
and
non-text
files
.

Text
files
can

be
directly
read
using
a
text
editor
such
as
Notepad	B	Notepad	Notepad_(software)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_(software)	000	000
in
Microsoft	B	Microsoft Windows	Microsoft_Windows	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows	000	000
Windows	I	Microsoft Windows	Microsoft_Windows	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows	000	000
.

These
files
often
have
extension
.

txt
but
can
often
have
other

extensions
(
a
common
one
we
will
use
is
.

csv
)
.

Example
:
For
the
text
file
carsdata.txt
Notepad

yields

Non-text
files
can
not
be
meaningfully
read
using
a
text
editor
such
as
Notepad	B	Notepad	Notepad_(software)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_(software)	000	000
.

Then
one
obtains
non-text
characters
that
appear
as
,
for
example
,
@Z

xxxxxxx

Example
:
For
the
non-text
file
carsdata.xls
(
an
Excel
file
)

Notepad
yields

Instead
non-text
files
can
only
be
read
using

special
software
.

In
this
example
an
Excel
file
can
be
meaningfully
read
using
the
Excel

program
.

FILE
FORMATS

The
most
common
data
formats
used
to
store
data
in

files
that
can
be

read
data
into
Excel
are
:

Existing
Excel
workbook
or
worksheet
with

extension
.

xls

This
is
easily
read
into
Excel
,
just
like
reading
a
Word	B	Word	Microsoft_Word	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word	000	000

file
with
extension
.

doc
using
MS	B	MS Word	Microsoft_Word	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word	000	000
Word	I	MS Word	Microsoft_Word	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word	000	000
.

Existing
Excel
workbook
or
worksheet
with

extension
.

xlsx

The
extension
.

xlsx
mean
that
the
file
is
in
Excel
2007

format
.

This
may
not
be
recognized
by
earlier
versions
of
Excel
such
as
Excel

97
or
Excel	B	Excel	Microsoft_Excel	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel	000	000
2003
.

Comma-separated
values
text
file
with
extension
.

csv

This
is
easily
read
into
Excel
.

Furthermore
,
because
this
is
a
text
file
it
can
be
read
by
many
other

programs
.

Text
file
,
often
with
extension
.

txt

or
extension
.

asc

This
can
be
read
into
Excel
but
information
about
the

formatting
of
the
data
needs
to
be
provided
,
as
explained
below
.

METHODS
TO
INPUT
DATA

Common
ways
to
input
data
into
Excel
are
:

Type
in
data
into
a
new
Excel
worksheet
.

Read
in
data
from
an
existing
Excel
workbook
.

Copy
data
from
an
existing
Excel
worksheet
.

Read
in
data
from
an
existing
comma-separated

values
text
file
.

Read
in
data
from
and
existing
text
file

(
possibly

downloaded

from
the
internet
)

and
convert
the
file
to
an
Excel
worksheet
.

Read
in
data
from
other
format
files
if
Excel

recognizes
this

format
.

1
.

TYPE
IN
DATA
INTO
A
NEW
EXCEL
WORKSHEET

Open
Excel
,
for
example
from
Windows
Start
Menu
|

Programs
.

This
immediately
puts
you
into
a
new
Excel
worksheet
,
or
prompts
you

to
ask
for
a
new
Excel
worksheet
.

Consider
entry
of
the
following
data
on
the
number

of
cars
in
a

household

(
first
column
)
and
the
number
of
persons
in
the
household
(
second

column
)
.

Type
the
data
into
cells
A1	B	A1	Arrows_A1	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrows_A1	000	000
:
A5	B	A5	ISO_216	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_216	000	000
and
cells
B1	B	B1	D1_road_(Croatia)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D1_road_(Croatia)	000	000
:
B5
.

(
Click
on
cell
A1	B	A1	Arrows_A1	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrows_A1	000	000

and

enter
1
and
then
enter
,
then
2
and
enter
...
)

Then
give
headers
to
the
two
columns
.

Put
cursor
in
cell
A1	B	A1	Arrows_A1	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrows_A1	000	000
and
right-click
and
select
Insert	B	Insert	Insert_key	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insert_key	000	000
and
then
select

Entire
Row
.

Then
in
the
new
blank
cell
A1	B	A1	Arrows_A1	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrows_A1	000	000
type
CARS	B	CARS	Automobile	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile	000	000
and
in
the
new
blank
cell
A2	B	A2	A2_motorway_(Switzerland)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A2_motorway_(Switzerland)	000	000

type
HH
SIZE
.

Now
headers
(
CARS
and
HH
SIZE
)
are
in
row
1
and
data

are
in
rows
2

to

6
.

The
final
data
are
:

Next
give
the
worksheet
a
name
.

Go
to
the
sheet
tab
at
the
bottom
,
which
may
be
called
Sheet
1
,

right-click

and
select
Rename
and
give
the
worksheet
a
name
.

Finally
save
the
workbook
by
using
Office
Button
and

Save	B	Save As	Computer_file_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file_management	000	000
As	I	Save As	Computer_file_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file_management	000	000
if
a
new
workbook

or
Office
Button
and
Save	B	Save	Computer_file_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file_management	000	000
if
saving
an
existing
workbook
.

If
typing
in
a
lot
of
data
it
is
obviously
best
to
save
the
workbook
a

number
of
times
before
typing
is
finished
.

.

READ
IN
DATA
FROM
AN
EXISTING
EXCEL
WORKBOOK

OR
WORKSHEET

This
is
the
easiest
,
if
you
have
approriate

version
(
s
)
of
Excel
.

Open
Excel
,
for
example
from
Start	B	Start Menu	Start_menu	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_menu	000	000
Menu	I	Start Menu	Start_menu	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_menu	000	000
|
Programs
.

Left-click
the
Office
Button
,
select
Open	B	Open	Open_(process)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_(process)	000	000
and
give
the
filename
or

browse
for
the
file
you

want
to
input
.

Usually
the
filename
will
have
extension
.

xls

or
.

xlsx

Excel	B	Excel 2007	Microsoft_Excel	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel	000	000
2007	I	Excel 2007	Microsoft_Excel	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel	000	000
should
read
all
previous
versions
of
Excel
files
,
though
not

vice-versa
.

For
example
,
read
in
the
file
carsdata.xls

(
which
is
an
Excel
97-2003
workbook
)
.

.

COPY
DATA
FROM
AN
EXISTING
EXCEL
WORKSHEET

Suppose
we
are
already
in
an
existing
worksheet

within
an
existing

workbook
.

Right
click
on
the
Worksheet
Tab
at
the
bottom
.

This
yields
the
Move
or
Copy
dialog
box

If
copy
is
to
the
existing
workbook
(
the
default
)

then
most
often

one

chooses
the
(
move
to
end
)
option
in
Before
Sheet
.

If
copy
is
to
a
new
workbook
then
choose
the
(
new

book
)
option
in

to

book
and
type
in
the
name
of
the
new
book
.

In
either
case
select
the
Create
a
Copy
option
.

Give
the
new
worksheet
an
appropriate
name
by
going

to
the
sheet
tab

at
the
bottom
,
right-click
and
select
rename
and
give
the
worksheet
a

name
.

4
.

READ
IN
DATA
FROM
A
COMMA-SEPARATED
VALUES
FILE

A
comma-separated
values
file
is
a
text
file
where

each
row
is
a
spreadsheet
row
and
each
entry
,
separated
by
a
comma
,
is

a
column
entry
for
that
row
.

The
first
row
provides
names
for
the
columns
of
the
spreadsheet
.

These
files
are
given
extension
.

csv
.

Excel
automatically
reads
in
files
with
extension
.

csv

Many
other
programs
are
able
to
read
in
data
a
.

csv

file
,
but
not
data
in
an
.

xls
file
.

It
is
a
standard
format
for
transferring
data
across
different
programs
.

For
example
the
file
carsdata.csv

is
a
text
file
with
the
following
entries

Related
text
files
include
tab-delimited
text

and
space-delimited
formatted
text
.

Skip
this
step
if
you
already
have
the
data
file
carsdata.txt
on

your
computer
.

In
your
web
browser
click
on

/
carsdata.txt
and

click
Open	B	Open	Open_(process)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_(process)	000	000
.

This
yields
the
Text
Import
Wizard

The
challenge
is
to
places
the
first
and
second

numbers
into
separate
columns
,
rather
than

combined
into
one
column
.

In
text
import
import
wizard

Choose
Delimited
if
the
data
are
delimited
and

Fixed
width
if
the

data
are
fixed
width
.

In
this
example
either
option
can
be
chosen
.

Set
the
Start	B	Start	Start_menu	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Start_menu	000	000
import
at
row
to
the
first
row
that

has
data
,
skipping
any
preceding
text
such
as
explanation
of
the
data
.

In
this
example
there
is
now
preceding
text
,
so
Start

import
at
row
1
.

So
Step
1
:
choose
Delimited	B	Delimited	Delimiter-separated_values	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values	000	000
and
Start
Import
at
Row

1
and
hit
Next	B	Next	NeXT	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT	000	000
.

This
yields
Step
2
.

The
default
Delimiter	B	Delimiter	Delimiter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter	000	000
is
Tab
.

Change
this
to
Space	B	Space	Space_(punctuation)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)	000	000
.

Then
check
that
the
Data
preview
has
correctly
split
up
the
data
,
as
is

the
case
below
.

Hit
next
.

This
yields
step
3
.

In
this
case
leave
the
column
data
format
as

general
.

Hit
Finish
.

This
should
give
you
an
Excel
worksheet
with
2
columns
and
5
rows
in

cells

has
consolidated
its
Engine
Services
Department
and
its
Commercial
Spare
Parts
Operation
into
a
single
,
$
1.8
billion
organization
,
GE
Engine
Services
,
headed
by
newly
named
general
manager
Tom
Brisken
.
"

This
new
structure
promises
decided
benefits
for
the
customer
,
particularly
in
the
areas
of
cost
and
time
savings
,
"
said
Brisken
.
"

Our
maintenance
shops
will
continue
to
provide
comprehensive
,
top-quality
overhaul
and
repair
of
engines
and
components
.

But
having
Commercial
Spares
as
an
integral
part
of
the
organization
ensures
optimum
coordination
in
those
cases
where
replacement
,
rather
than
repair
,
serves
the
best
interests
of
the
customer
.
"

GE
Engine
Services
,
the
largest
integrated
engine
maintenance
provider
in
the
world
,
is
experiencing
substantial
growth
,
based
on
business
volume
.

Over
a
40-year
period
,
GE
Engine
Services
has
repaired
more
than
100,000
engines
and
currently
provides
complete

aircraft
engines
,
as
well
as
GE
's
LM
series
of
aeroderivative
engines
for
marine
and
industrial
applications
.

In
addition
,
GE
Engine
Services
is
a
dynamic
,
innovative
organization
,
as
is
evidenced
by
its
investment
,
over
the
past
five
years
,
of
approximately
$
150
million
in
new
facilities
,
processes
,
and
technological
advances
and
the
introduction
of
programs
such
as
Maintenance
Cost
Per
Hour
(
MCPH
)
and
On-Wing
Management
.

Susan
Pittman
heads
the
Commercial
Spares
Operation
of
GE
Engine
Services
,
and
Bob
Malone
will
continue
as
director
of
sales
for
GE
Engine
Services
.

Two
new
service
general
managers
have
been
appointed
at
the
service
shops
:

Finals
pain
before
success

August
22nd
2006
05:29

After
seven
consecutive
wins
,
the
Fremantle	B	Fremantle Dockers	Fremantle_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club	000	000
Dockers	I	Fremantle Dockers	Fremantle_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club	000	000
are
being
talked
up
as
legitimate
premiership
contenders
.

Some
commentators
of
the
game
are
even
going
as
far
to
suggest
that
a
Dockers	B	Dockers	Fremantle_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club	000	000
flag
in
2006
is
n't
out
of
the
realms
of
possibility
,
and
while
this
a
romantic
notion
it
is
n't
necessarily
in
lines
with
reality
.

History
suggests
that
a
side
needs
to
experience
finals
pain
before
they
can
genuinely
contend
for
the
premiership
.

The
Dockers	B	Dockers	Fremantle_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club	000	000
cross-town
rivals
West	B	West Coast	West_Coast_Eagles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Eagles	000	000
Coast	I	West Coast	West_Coast_Eagles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Eagles	000	000
fell
short
at
the
last
hurdle
in
1991
against
Hawthorn	B	Hawthorn	Hawthorn_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorn_Football_Club	000	000
,
but
bounced
back
the
next
season
to
claim
the
first
of
two
premierships
in
three
years
for
the
club
.

Even
Brisbane	B	Brisbane	Brisbane	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane	000	000
,
regarded
by
many
as
the
greatest
side
of
the
modern
era
played
five
finals
from
1999
to
2000
before
claiming
the
first
of
three
flags
in
2001
.

Compare
this
with
Fremantle	B	Fremantle	Fremantle_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club	000	000
who
have
played
one
final
since
their
inception
in
1995
-
a
44-point
loss
to
Essendon	B	Essendon	Essendon_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essendon_Football_Club	000	000
at
Subiaco	B	Subiaco	Subiaco_Oval	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subiaco_Oval	000	000
in
2003
,
and
you
can
see
why
any
talk
of

a
Docker	B	Docker	Fremantle_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club	000	000
premiership
is
premature
.

One
only
has
to
ask
the
likes
of
Port	B	Port Adelaide	Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	000	000
Adelaide	I	Port Adelaide	Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	000	000
,
Sydney	B	Sydney	Sydney_Swans	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans	000	000
or
St	B	St Kilda	St_Kilda_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Kilda_Football_Club	000	000
Kilda	I	St Kilda	St_Kilda_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Kilda_Football_Club	000	000
to
find
out
how
hard
it
is
to
win
a
premiership
.

Consider
this
,
the
Power	B	Power	Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	000	000
played
seven
finals
from
2001-03
and
were
arguably
the
best
side
in
the
competition
during
the
season
proper
,
having
collected
three
straight
minor
premierships
from
2002-04
,
but
did
n't
snag
their
first
flag
until
'
04
.

The
Saints	B	Saints	St._George_Illawarra_Dragons	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Illawarra_Dragons	000	000
would
have
to
join
Port	B	Port	Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	000	000
as
the
most
unlucky
side
of
the
modern
era
.

The
men
from
Moorabbin	B	Moorabbin	Moorabbin,_Victoria	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorabbin,_Victoria	000	000
have
n't
tasted
premiership
success
since
1966
,
and
have
lost
consecutive
preliminary
finals
to
the
Power	B	Power	Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	000	000
and
Sydney	B	Sydney	Sydney_Swans	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans	000	000
respectively
.

One
would
suggest
that
the
premiership
window
has
closed
on
the
Saints	B	Saints	St._George_Illawarra_Dragons	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Illawarra_Dragons	000	000
.

Even
last
year
's
premiers
have
fallen
short
in
recent
years
prior
to
their
success
of
2005
.

The
Swans	B	Swans	Sydney_Swans	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans	000	000
lost
a
preliminary
final
to
eventual
premiers
Brisbane	B	Brisbane	Brisbane	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane	000	000
in
2003
,
after
being
right
in
the
match
at
three-quarter
time
and
seemingly
having
the
Lions	B	Lions	Lions_(Super_Rugby)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_(Super_Rugby)	000	000
on
the
rope
.

Sydney	B	Sydney	Sydney_Swans	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans	000	000
experienced
more
pain
in
'04
when
they
were
comprehensively
beaten
by
the
Saints	B	Saints	St._George_Illawarra_Dragons	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Illawarra_Dragons	000	000
to
the
tune
of
61
points
in
a
semi-final
.

Would
you
have
predicted
the
Swans	B	Swans	Sydney_Swans	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans	000	000
to
come
out
the
following
season
and
capture
the
flag
?

Probably
not
,
but
it
's
clear
that
they
were
better
for
the
experience
.

Experience
is
the
key
,
something
which
Fremantle
lacks
,
with
only
skipper
Peter
Bell,hard-man
Josh
Carr
,
Jarrad
Schofield
and
former
Lion
Des
Headland
tasting
premiership
success

Adding
further
weight
to
the
lack
of
experience
argument
is
the
fact
that
the
three
players
in
the
Fremantle	B	Fremantle	Fremantle_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club	000	000
squad
to
have
played
the
most
finals
have
done
so
with
other
clubs
,
Jarrad	B	Jarrad Schofield	Jarrad_Schofield	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Schofield	000	000
Schofield	I	Jarrad Schofield	Jarrad_Schofield	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrad_Schofield	000	000
(

)
with
Port	B	Port Adelaide	Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	000	000
Adelaide	I	Port Adelaide	Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club	000	000
,
Peter	B	Peter Bell	Peter_Bell_(Australian_footballer_born_1976)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bell_(Australian_footballer_born_1976)	000	000
Bell	I	Peter Bell	Peter_Bell_(Australian_footballer_born_1976)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bell_(Australian_footballer_born_1976)	000	000
(
16
)
with
the
Kangaroos	B	Kangaroos	North_Melbourne_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne_Football_Club	000	000
and
Dockers	B	Dockers	Fremantle_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club	000	000
and
Jeff	B	Jeff Farmer	Jeff_Farmer_(footballer)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Farmer_(footballer)	000	000
Farmer	I	Jeff Farmer	Jeff_Farmer_(footballer)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Farmer_(footballer)	000	000
(
7
)
with
Melbourne	B	Melbourne	Melbourne_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Football_Club	000	000
and
Freo	B	Freo	Fremantle_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club	000	000
.

Thus
any
talk
of
a
Fremantle	B	Fremantle	Fremantle_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club	000	000
premiership
is
all
too
premature
.

Let
them
win
a
final
first
and
see
where
it
takes
them
.

Remember
,
finals
pain
before
premiership
gain
.

Judge
:
Red

owe
property
taxes
on
Harrison
stadiumA
New	B	New Jersey	New_Jersey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey	000	000
Jersey	I	New Jersey	New_Jersey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey	000	000
tax-court
judge
has
ruled
that
the
New	B	New York Red Bulls	New_York_Red_Bulls	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls	000	000
York	I	New York Red Bulls	New_York_Red_Bulls	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls	000	000

Bulls	I	New York Red Bulls	New_York_Red_Bulls	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls	000	000
owe
property
tax
to
the
city
of
Harrison	B	Harrison	Harrison_(PATH_station)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_(PATH_station)	000	000
,
despite
playing
in
a
stadium
built
on
land
owned
by
a
tax-exempt
public
agency
.

The
decision
,
if
upheld
,
means
that
the
team
owes
$
3.6
million
in
back
taxes
for
2010
and
2011
,
plus
similar
amounts
going
forward
.

Without
getting
too
deep
into
tax
law
,
public
land
usually
goes
untaxed
--
but
it
can
be
taxed
,
or
can
be
subject
to
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
,
if
it
's
used
for
a
strictly
private
purpose
.

Given
that
all
the
money
collected
at
Red	B	Red Bull Arena	Red_Bull_Arena_(New_Jersey)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Arena_(New_Jersey)	000	000
Bull	I	Red Bull Arena	Red_Bull_Arena_(New_Jersey)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Arena_(New_Jersey)	000	000
Arena	I	Red Bull Arena	Red_Bull_Arena_(New_Jersey)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Arena_(New_Jersey)	000	000
flows
to
the
Red	B	Red Bulls	New_York_Red_Bulls	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls	000	000
Bulls	I	Red Bulls	New_York_Red_Bulls	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls	000	000
,
the
judge
ruled
that
the
"
public
"
nature
of
the
land
was
an
accounting
fiction
,
and
demanded
that
the
team
cough
up
.

Whether
cash-strapped
Harrison	B	Harrison	Harrison_(PATH_station)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_(PATH_station)	000	000
will
see
any
money
from
this
anytime
soon
is

this
out
for
years
.

(
They
're
also
still
stiffing
the
city
on
$
150,000
a
year
in
rent
.
)

But
at
least
there
's
a
chance
of
the
city
getting
something
back
for
its
$
80
million
in
land
and
infrastructure
and
$
173
million
new

,
aside
from
a
bunch
of
muddy
lots
set
aside
for
theoretical
future
development
.

(
According
to
Business	B	Business Week	Bloomberg_Businessweek	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Businessweek	000	000
Week	I	Business Week	Bloomberg_Businessweek	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Businessweek	000	000

payments
from
developers
are
running
at
just
over
one-tenth
what
was
projected
when

arena
project
was
first
planned
.
)

Given
the
number
of
teams
that
use
the
public-land
,
private-use
dodge
to
avoid
a
stadium
tax
bill
--
which
is
to
say
,
pretty
much
all
of
them
--
it
's
going
to
be
interesting
to
see
if
this
ruling
sets
any
kind
of
precedent
.

Given
that
tax
law
varies
widely
from
state
to
state
,
and
who
knows
if
this
will
hold
up
under
appeal
anyway
,
probably
not
,
but
it
's
an
interesting
idea
for
local
governments
to
try
to
recoup
some
of
the
money
they
blew
on
stadiums
in
the
hopes
of
sparking
development
that
never
arrived

The

Bulls	I	Red Bulls	New_York_Red_Bulls	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls	000	000
are
welcome
in
Harrison	B	Harrison	Harrison_(PATH_station)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_(PATH_station)	000	000
.

They
can
pay
taxes
like
the
rest
of
us
overtaxed
property
owners
.

The
services
the
town
provides
in
handling
road
traffic
and
what
we
have
given
up
in
convenient
parking
near
the
PATH	B	PATH	Port_Authority_Trans-Hudson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Authority_Trans-Hudson	000	000
station
,
not
to
mention
the
huge
property
tax
increases
we
face
for
debt
servicing
are
horrific
.

This
town
is
organized
enough
,
and
angry
enough
to
make
the
Red	B	Red Bulls	New_York_Red_Bulls	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls	000	000
Bulls	I	Red Bulls	New_York_Red_Bulls	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls	000	000
pay
up
or
move
out
completely
.

If
they
would
like
to
stall
by
appealing
the
decision
,
let
's
counter
by
forcing
the
stadium
to
go
dark
and
let
them
sue
us
for
eviction
for
failure
to
pay
rent
.

Not
paying
contractual
or
court
ordered
settlements
can
work
both
ways
.

I
would
sincerely
advise
them
to
come
to
some
amicable
terms
very
,
very
quickly
:
the
Mayor
should
propose
to
EITHER
enforce
the
entire
tax
or
enforce
a
more
equitable
rent
:
say
$
320k
per
month
(
to
pay
for
services
)
and
give
the
team
30
days
max
to
consider
the
deal
.

The
next
Mayor
of
Harrison	B	Harrison	Harrison_(PATH_station)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_(PATH_station)	000	000
will
have
a
100
%
mandate
to
start
blocking
all
access
to
the
stadium
unless
a
deal
is
reached
,
and
that
's
for
starters
.

Any
retained
attorney
that
advises
the
team
otherwise
is
merely
padding
their
own
fees
:
they
shall
not
win
anything
for
their
client
.

I
'd
rather
vote
for
town
bankruptcy
and
merger
with
Newark	B	Newark	Newark,_New_Jersey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark,_New_Jersey	000	000
or
Hudson	B	Hudson County	Hudson_County,_New_Jersey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_County,_New_Jersey	000	000
County	I	Hudson County	Hudson_County,_New_Jersey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_County,_New_Jersey	000	000
with
cancellation
of
all
civic
services
than
let
the
Red	B	Red BullS	New_York_Red_Bulls	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls	000	000
BullS	I	Red BullS	New_York_Red_Bulls	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls	000	000
--
t
get
away
with
leveraging
against
blue
collar
local
home
owners
.

Sincere
advice
to
Trenton	B	Trenton	Trenton,_New_Jersey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenton,_New_Jersey	000	000
and
beyond
:
this
has
the
potential
to
flare
into
a
much
bigger
,
much
nastier
,
front
page
kind
of
embarrassment
.

Suggest
that
the
phone
calls
start
going
out
to
counsel
in
this
case
:
the
patience
of
the
citizens
has
expired
.

People
here
would
like

hear
about

Our

Assessor
actually
endorsed
the
stadium
despite
the
lack
of
property
taxes
that
will
be
paid
because
the
city
owns
the
land
so
it
's
being
billed
as
a
'
municipal
'
stadium
although
its
purpose
is
as
an
NFL	B	NFL	National_Football_League	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League	000	000

Can
someone
help

understand
the
1.8
Mil
a
year
assessment
?

Is
it
based
on
a
full
year
(
365
days
a

)
of
occupancy
?

If
there
were
other
tenants
would
they
need
to
split
the
tax
?

Anyone
know
if
there
were
other
events
there
?

JB
;

Matters
relating
to
assessment
are
complex
,
particularly
as
applied
to
commercial
and
'
non-linear
'
properties
.

I
deal
with
assessment
appeals
(
though
not
in
New	B	New Jersey	New_Jersey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey	000	000
Jersey	I	New Jersey	New_Jersey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey	000	000
)
and
thus
have
some
general
background
in
this
area
.

Every
jurisdiction
has
it
's
own
rules
and
regs
as
relates
to
assessment
and
taxation
,
and
I
make
no
pretense
toward
knowing
what
these
are
in
the
state
of
NJ	B	NJ	New_Jersey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey	000	000
.

In
general
terms
,
commercial
buildings
and
non
linear
property
(
things
like
trains
,
utility
distribution
systems
etc
)
are
not
assessed
based
on
their
replacement
or
"
willing
buyer/willing
seller
"
fair
market
value
(
as
private
homes
generally
are
)
.

The
reason
for
this
is
pretty
obvious
,
given
that
these
types
of
properties
tend
to
sell
infrequently
and
when
they
do
the
price
rarely
reflects
the
cost
to
build
or
rebuild
the
same
asset
.

In
general
,
commercial
property
is
valued
based
on
it
's
highest
and
best
use
(
which
is
n't
always
what
the
land
is
currently
used
for
...
for
example
,
if
you
had
an
old
barn
on
10
acres
of
land
in
mid
town
Manhattan	B	Manhattan	Manhattan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan	000	000
,
you
would
n't
be
paying
taxes
based
on
the
value
of
the
farmland
,
but
on
what
it
would
sell
for
if
it
was
presently
on
the
market
and
zoned
for
a
use
consistent
with
it
's
surroundings
)
.

Some
types
of
commercial
property
are
valued
based
on
annual
income
(
or
potential
)
.

This
is
a
common
method
for
rental
and
hotel
properties
.

We
would
need
to
know
what
method
(
s
)
the
assessor
used
to
arrive
at
an
accurate
explanation
for
the
value
given
for
this
particular
land
and
building
,
but
I
would
assume
RBA	B	RBA	Reserve_Bank_of_Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia	000	000
has
been
assessed
based
on
it
's
income
potential
.

Although
it
may
seem
counter-intuitive
,
it
is
not
uncommon
for
multimillion
dollar
sports
facilities
(
or
other
types
of
buildings
)
to
be
assessed
at
10-20
%
of
their
construction
cost
-
even
when
they
seem
practically
new
.

This
is
a
reflection
of
the
income
generating
ability
of
the
building
itself
as
a
standalone
asset
(
whether
or
not
such
a
building
is
a
good
investment
when
it
is
assessed
at
15
%
of
it
's
cost
one
year
after
opening
is
another
matter
entirely
...
)

In
the
rare
instances
where
these
facilities
are
sold
(
generally
by
the
municipality
that
built
and
owns
them
)
,
they
often
sell
for
a
value
not
far
from
the
"
10-20
%
"
value
mentioned
above
-
sometimes
much
less
(
see
Skydome	B	Skydome	Rogers_Centre	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Centre	000	000
)
.

As
I
understand
the
lease/ownership
arrangement
at
RBA	B	RBA	Reserve_Bank_of_Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia	000	000
,
the
club
paid
for
the
building
(
more
or
less
)
and
are
the
owners
of
same
.

Thus
,
they
are
subject
to
any
tax
burden
deemed
payable
by
the
state
(
assuming
the
present
judgment
is
n't
reversed
on
appeal
)
regardless
of
what
other
tenants
might
be
present
or
events
may
be
held
.

This
amount
could
be
reduced
if
,
for
example
,
the
stadium
owners
have
agreed
to
payments
in
lieu
of
taxes
(
Pilots
)
to
cover
things
like
infrastructure
connections
,
policing
and
the
like
.

As
far
as
I
know
,
they
have
n't
done
so
,
but
I
am
not
fully
familiar
with
RBA	B	RBA	Reserve_Bank_of_Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia	000	000
or
any
agreements
made
with
the
city/state
.

Hope
that
helps
...

It

John
,

It
's
interesting
to
note
that
sports
facilities
depreciate
like
cars
do
.

Glitzy
and
fun
when
new
but
hardly
someone
should
view
as
a
solid
investment
to
own
.

In
Santa	B	Santa Clara	Santa_Clara,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California	000	000
Clara	I	Santa Clara	Santa_Clara,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California	000	000
the
mayor
is
trying
to
refer
to
it
as
a
"
municipal
"
stadium
.

The
49ers
will
be
paying
no
property
tax
.

The
Santa
Clara
County
Assessor
is
all
with
this
because
he
likes
the
49ers
so
much
.

The
whole
day
just
never
felt
right
.

The
gloomy
weather
,
a
fine
mist
covering
the
tail
-
Gators	B	Gators	Florida_Gators	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators	000	000
before
the
game
.

The
huge
gaps
of
empty
seats
in
the
stands
,
not
unpredictable
but
still
embarrassing
.

getting
boat-raced
for

lost

last
week.A
text
I
received
from
my
wife
said
it
all
,
“
Is
this
really
happening
?
”

Yes
,
it
was
and
because
Florida	B	Florida	Florida_Gators_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators_football	000	000
did
n't
panic
and
made
adjustments
and
because
Furman	B	Furman	Furman,_South_Carolina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman,_South_Carolina	000	000
does
n't
have
a
player
Florida	B	Florida	Florida_Gators_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators_football	000	000
would
even
invite

,
the
Gators	B	Gators	Florida_Gators	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators	000	000
prevailed
.

Across
the
country
,
fans
saw
the
54-32
final
and
may
have
no
idea
how
unsettling
it
was
at

at
around
2:15
p.m.
Saturday.Could
they
possibly
lose
to
Furman?At
the
time
,
it
looked
very
possible
.

At
the
time
,
you
wondered
if
the
Gator	B	Gator	Gator_(game)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gator_(game)	000	000
defense
would
make
Furman	B	Furman	Furman,_South_Carolina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman,_South_Carolina	000	000
punt
the
entire
game
.

At
the
time
,
you
wondered
if
anything
else
could
go
wrong
.

“
You
start
to
realize
that
if
anything
could
go
wrong
,
it
already
has
,
”
Will	B	Will Muschamp	Will_Muschamp	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Muschamp	000	000
Muschamp	I	Will Muschamp	Will_Muschamp	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Muschamp	000	000
said.Don
'
t
look
for
me
to
put
a
positive
spin
on
this
game.Sure
,
the
Gators
won
by
three
touchdowns.Sure
,
Florida
is
bowl
eligible.And
yes
,
the
Gators	B	Gators	Florida_Gators	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators	000	000
will
get
extra
practices
leading
up
to
what
is
almost
definitely
a
Gator	B	Gator Bowl	Gator_Bowl	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gator_Bowl	000	000
Bowl	I	Gator Bowl	Gator_Bowl	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gator_Bowl	000	000
appearance
Jan.
2
.

“
It
's
an
extra
spring
practice
,
”
Muschamp
said.Great
.

More
practices
we
ca
n't
watch.But
this
win
said
as
much
about
this
season
as
the
losses
have.Because
it
was
Furman.I
know
the
Paladins
came
in
here
fired
up
for
a
chance
to
play
in
The	B	The Swamp	Cajun_Field	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun_Field	000	000
Swamp	I	The Swamp	Cajun_Field	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cajun_Field	000	000
.

I
know
they
changed
their
offense
during
the
week
and
surprised
the
Gators	B	Gators	Florida_Gators	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators	000	000
.

But
that
only
accounts
for
the
67
yards
(
all
on
running
plays
)
on
Furman	B	Furman	Furman,_South_Carolina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman,_South_Carolina	000	000
's
first
drive
.

What
about
the
other
379
?

“
Once
we
identified
what
they
were
doing
,
we
played
better
,
”
Muschamp	B	Muschamp	Will_Muschamp	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Muschamp	000	000
said.After
that
first
drive
,
Furman	B	Furman	Furman,_South_Carolina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman,_South_Carolina	000	000
had
17
first
downs
and
averaged
5.8
yards
per
play
.

That
is
not
a
good
defense
.

If
you
saw
it
,
you
do
n't
need
the
raw
numbers
to
know
how
this
defense
did
n't
show
up
to
play
.

The
Gators	B	Gators	Florida_Gators	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators	000	000
missed
enough
tackles
to
fill
a
lowlight
tape
and
so
many
times
Furman	B	Furman	Furman,_South_Carolina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman,_South_Carolina	000	000
running
backs
moved
the
pile
as
if
they
were
being
tackled
by
Pop	B	Pop Warner	Glenn_Scobey_Warner	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Scobey_Warner	000	000
Warner	I	Pop Warner	Glenn_Scobey_Warner	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Scobey_Warner	000	000
defenders.That
's
how
it
got
to
be
22-7
Furman	B	Furman	Furman,_South_Carolina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman,_South_Carolina	000	000
after
the
first
quarter
.

That
's
how
that
noise
you
heard
if
you
had
your
windows
open
was
the
Gator	B	Gator	Gator_(game)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gator_(game)	000	000
fans
who
did
show
up
squirming
in
their
seats
.

That
's
how
it
was
still
a
game
early
in
the
fourth
quarter
and
I
uttered
a
phrase
I
never
thought
I
would
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
the
Furman	B	Furman	Furman,_South_Carolina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman,_South_Carolina	000	000
game
--
“
That
was
a
huge
field
goal
by
Caleb	B	Caleb Sturgis	Caleb_Sturgis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Sturgis	000	000
Sturgis	I	Caleb Sturgis	Caleb_Sturgis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caleb_Sturgis	000	000
.
”

In
the
end
,
Florida	B	Florida	Florida_Gators_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators_football	000	000
won
because
it
did
the
two
things
it
has
n't
done
during
the
rest
of
the
season
.1
.

The
wide
receivers
were
a
factor
.

They
caught
seven
passes
for
250
yards
and
three
touchdowns
.

There
was
even
a
Quinton
Dunbar
sighting
.

The
phenom
of
the
preseason
had
a
couple
of
big
catches
,
including
a
touchdown
reception
.2
.

They
had
two
pick-sixes
.

We
had
forgotten
what
those
looked
like
.

But
the
Gators	B	Gators	Florida_Gators	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators	000	000
iced
the
game
with
two
nice
plays
from
Pop
Saunders
and
Jelani	B	Jelani Jenkins	Jelani_Jenkins	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelani_Jenkins	000	000
Jenkins	I	Jelani Jenkins	Jelani_Jenkins	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelani_Jenkins	000	000
,
who
had
made
a
habit
of
dropping
interceptions
this
season
.

“
I
had
visions
of
when
I
was
in
high
school
playing
running
back
,
”
Jenkins	B	Jenkins	Jelani_Jenkins	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelani_Jenkins	000	000
said
of
his
75-yard
touchdown
sprint.I
heard
a
few
boos
Saturday
when
Florida	B	Florida	Florida_Gators_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators_football	000	000
fell
behind
by
two
touchdowns
thanks
in
part
to
another
snap
over
the
head
of
quarterback
John	B	John Brantley	John_Brantley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brantley	000	000
Brantley	I	John Brantley	John_Brantley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brantley	000	000
.

There
were
more
silly
penalties
,
one
on
Matt	B	Matt Elam	Matt_Elam	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Elam	000	000
Elam	I	Matt Elam	Matt_Elam	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Elam	000	000
that
set
up
Furman	B	Furman	Furman,_South_Carolina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman,_South_Carolina	000	000
at
the
Florida	B	Florida	Florida_Gators_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators_football	000	000
49
on
the
opening
kickoff
of
the
second
half
.

There
was
the
requisite
1-yard
loss
on
a
completed
pass
on
third-and-7
.

And
the
offensive
line
continued
to
shuffle
because
of
injuries
,
one
of
the
reasons
it
was
unable
to
open
running
lanes
against
a
6-5
FCS	B	FCS	NCAA_Division_I_Football_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_Football_Championship	000	000
team.For
much
of
the
season
,
Gator	B	Gator	Gator_(game)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gator_(game)	000	000
fans
have
lamented
that
their
team
was
just
a
few
plays
away
from
having
a
respectable
record
.

This
game
made
you
wonder
how
they
were
competitive
with
Auburn	B	Auburn	Auburn_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_Tigers_football	000	000
,
Georgia	B	Georgia	Georgia_Bulldogs_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football	000	000
and
South	B	South Carolina	South_Carolina_Gamecocks_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Gamecocks_football	000	000
Carolina	I	South Carolina	South_Carolina_Gamecocks_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Gamecocks_football	000	000
.

Saturday
was
important
for
these
Gators	B	Gators	Florida_Gators	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators	000	000
to
become
bowl
eligible
.

But
I
'm
not
sure
it
showed
that
these
Gators	B	Gators	Florida_Gators	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Gators	000	000

would
provide
the
title
information
as
soon

Al
Trakimas
noted
that
he
had

a
draft
plan
showing
the
detailed
grading
around
the

but
the

.

The
extension
of
the
Rice
Road
drainage
system
is
the
issue
.

The
proposed
extension
of
the
piping
at
the
end
of
Rice
Road
into
a
stone
swale
would
require
a
waiver
here
.

Ms.
Murphy
asked
the
Board	B	Board	Local_board_of_health	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_board_of_health	000	000
to
consider
,
given
the
waivers
that
the
applicant
was
requesting
,
whether
they
were
willing
to
proceed
with
the
hearing
and
hear
the
applicant
's
full
presentation
.

Board
members
agreed
to
continue
the
hearing
.

Al
Trakimas
provided
an
overview
of
the
proposed
roadway
drainage
,
which
would
include
traditional
subsurface
pipes
leading
to
two
catch
basins
at
the
throat
of
the
cu-de
sac
.

Water
would
flow
from
the
basins
into
two
Vortechnics
units
and
through
a
series
of
stepped
manholes
,
ultimately
discharging
at
the
wetlands
below
.

Roadwork
would
begin
at
the
two
existing
catch
basins
on
Simmons
Road
,
where
the
applicant
proposed
to
saw
cut
and
match
the
existing
pavement
.

The
roadway
would
slope
down
to
the
west
at
approximately
8
%
grade
,
flattening
out
at
the
cul-de-sac
to
3
%
.

The
cul-de-sac
would
be
120
'
in
width
.

A
4
"
water
line
would
be
hooked
up
to
the
existing
2
"
water
line
on
Simmons
Road
.

A
new
hydrant
would
be
located
in
the
cul-de-sac
,
serving
this
new
portion
of
Simmons
Road
.

Mr.
Trakimas
said
that
they
had
looked
into
the
possibility
of
looping
the
water
line
at
Rice
Road
,
but
that
Aquarion
Water
co.
had
indicated
that
this
would
not
be
possible
.

Mr.
Trakimas
acknowledged
that
the
project
design
included
several
side
slopes
which
exceeded
that
maximum
2:1
slope
.

He
pointed
out
,
however
,
that
if
you
just
looked
at
the
construction
of
the
roadway
,
and
not
the
adjacent
lots
,
that
the
extent
of
excessive
side
slopes
was
greatly
reduced
.

The
actual
house
locations
shown
on
the
plans
were
conceptual
in
nature
,
when
in
fact
they
could
be
placed
in
other
locations
.

Board
members
questioned
the
logic
behind
taking
this
approach
towards
the
review
of
the
project
,
and
Mr.
Devin
responded
that
"
you
have
to
start
somewhere
"
in
terms
of
project
approval
.

Paul
Healey
asked
if
this
would
mean
that
house
foundations
would
have
to
be
built
into
the
fill
put
in
place
to
create
the
elevation
for
the
roadway
.

Mr.
Trakimas
responded
that
it
might
.

Paul
Healey
asked
what
the
downside
of
the
proposed
"
stepped
manholes
"
would
be
in
terms
of
the
functionality
of
the
drainage
system
.

Al
responded
that
this
type
of
stepped
system
is
common
for
sewer
systems
.

Susan
Murphy
asked
Paul
Brogna
to
look
into
this
and
report
back
at
the
next
meeting
.

Al
Trakimas
finished
up
by
stating
that
utility
companies
had
all
been
contacted
,
and
had
provided
their
preliminary
approval
of
the
plans
.

Judy
Sneath
asked
whether
the
construction
of
the
roadway
would
impact
the
single
family
lot
owned
by
D'Allesandro
on
the
south
side
of
Simmons
Road
adjacent
to
the
proposed
subdivision
.

Mr.
Trakimas
responded
that
the
grading
for
the
roadway
would
cut
into
this
property
.

Ms.
Sneath
expressed
concern
about
the
quality
of
the
filled
soil
on
that
lot
.

Paul
Brogna
was
instructed
to
look
into
industry
standards
for
the
type
of
soil
permitted
for
side
slopes
.

Judy
Sneath
and
Paul
Healey
asked
why
this
lot
was
not
part
of
the
subdivision
.

Mr.
Devin
explained
that
it
would
be
a
legal
Form
A
lot
should
the
road
be
extended
.

Tod
McGrath
asked
about
the
quantity
of
fill
that
would
be
required
to
build
this
project
.

Mr.
Trakimas
responded
that
if
the
house
lots
were
to
be
built
it
would
require
7000
cubic
yards
of
cut
and
17000
cubic
yards
of
fill
.

To
bring
in
the
fill
would
require
400-600
dump
trucks
of
fill
to
be
brought
to
the
site
.

For
just
the
roadway
to
be
built
it
would
require
2,300
cubic
yards
of
cut
,
and
7,000
cubic
yards
of
fill
,
or
a
net
of
5,000
cubic
yards
of
fill
(
200-400
dump
trucks
)
.

He
explained
that
a
staging
area
would
be
created
to
the
dump
trucks
to
turn
around
.

Susan
Murphy
pointed
out
that
if
houses
were
to
be
built
on
these
lots
they
would
require
a
variance
from
the
height
by-law
in
that
the
bottom
of
the
basement
slab
would
be
more
than
five
feet
above
the
existing
grade
.

She
pointed
out
that
subdivisions
can
be
denied
if
they
assume
noncompliance
with
zoning
.

Tod
McGrath
asked
why
the
developer
would
want
to
proceed
with
this
project
when
they
might
only
get
to
develop
one
lot
.

Susan
Murphy
asked
if
they
could
build
the
project
without
the
waivers
.

Al
Trakimas
responded
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
,
but
that
it
could
be
done
using
extensive
retaining
walls
.

Susan
reiterated
her
concern
about
how
the
Fee	B	Fee	Fee	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee	000	000
's
property
would
be
impacted
by
the
extension
of
Simmons
Road
,
and
pointed
out
that
the
Subdivision
Control
specifically
states
that
new
subdivisions
linking
to
existing
subdivisions
can
not
damage
or
harm
the
properties
on
the
existing
roadways
.

Abutters
expressed
concern
about
the
impacts
of
construction
on
the
neighborhood
during
construction
including
truck
traffic
and
noise
,
damage
to
a
public
way
,
disruption
and
removal
of
potentially
toxic
materials
,
and
difficulty
for
emergency
access
.

The
hearing
was
continued
to
July
24
at
8:00
PM
.

This
was
a
continuation
of
a
hearing
initiated
on
June
13
,
2006
.

The
applicant
is
currently
applying
for
a
Special
Permit
A-3
(
parking
determination
)
in
connection
with
a
change
of
use
of
the
property
at
20

from
a

.

The

a

(
and
thus
the
required

for
the

as
a

)
,
as
the

that
the

will
simply
replace

showing

to
the
property
at

.

Ms.
Murphy
opened
the
hearing
by
noting
that
letters
had
been
received
by
Pat
MacAllen
and
Jim
MacAllen
expressing
concern
with
the
proposed
use
of
20
Free
Street
for
church
office
use
.

Ms.
Murphy
also
followed
up
with
a
report
from
Ms.
Lacy
regarding
past
Special
Permits
issued
for
the
church
indicating
that
there
were
no
conflicts
between
the
request
currently
before
the
Board	B	Board	Local_board_of_health	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_board_of_health	000	000
and
existing
permits
.

She
noted
that
the
when
the
church
received
a
parking
determination
in
1987
indicating
that
150
parking
spaces
was
sufficient
,
and
that
they
now
have
175
spaces
.

While
the
church
population
may
have
increased
,
in
terms
of
how
parking
needs
are
required
(
by
number
of
seats
and
square
footage
of
office/classroom
use
)
the
church
still
complied
with
this
original
determination
.

Brad
Warner
presented
the
revised
site
plan
showing
a
pervious
paved
walkway
located
approximately
25
'
from
the
western
property
line
,
and
vegetative
screening
on
the
western
property
boundary
with
the
adjacent
house
.

He
explained
that
screening
was
not
put
in
on
the
other
side
due
to
the
presence
of
existing
vegetation
and
the
fact
that
the
garage
for
the
abutting
property
was
located
right
on
the
property
line
blocking
views
.

Mr.
Warner
reiterated
that
the
use
of
the
building
did
not
represent
an
increase
in
the
intensity
of
use
at
the
church
,
but
simply
a
relocation
of
uses
from
the
church
building
to
20
Free
Street
.

Abutter
Mary
Ellen
McCabe
noted
that
she
wanted
screening
along
the
entire
length
of
her
property
.

At
8:45
Paul
Healey
made
a
motion
to
close
the
hearing
,
and
vote
to
issue
the
Special
Permit
A3
with
conditions
.

Tod
McGrath
seconded
the
motion
and
all
approved
.

The
Board	B	Board	Local_board_of_health	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_board_of_health	000	000
began
deliberations
on
the
proposed
conditions
to
the
permit
.

Board
members
agreed
that
the
request
for
relief
from
the
requirements
of
the
parking
by-law
was
appropriate
,
and
that
there
was
sufficient
parking
at
the
church
to
serve
the
uses
that
would
be
housed
in
the
church
and
at
20
Free
Street
.

They
recognized
that
the
use
of
the
building
did
not
represent
an
increase
in
the
intensity
of
use
at
the
church
,
but
simply
a
relocation
of
uses
from
the
church
building
to
20
Free
Street
.

Mr.
Healey
acknowledged
that
the
path
leading
from
the
church
to
the
house
at
20
Free
Street
could
represent
an
invasion
of
privacy
for
the
neighbors
by
inviting
the
public
into
the
traditionally
private
realm
of
backyards
.

Board
members
determined
that
additional
screening
should
be
provided
on
the
west
side
of
the
property
to
screen
the
abutters
at
22
Free
Street
.

Board
members
discussed
the
potential
difficulties
associated
with
enforcing
many
of
the
conditions
proposed
by
the
abutters
associated
with
the
use
of
the
property
during
non-business
hours
and
by
groups
of
adults
.

Tod
McGrath
pointed
out
that
the
proposed
building
layout
,
consisting
of
small
office
spaces
,
did
not
seem
conducive
to
group
gatherings
.

Judy
Sneath
felt
that
placing
too
many
constraints
on
uses
would
,
in
effect
,
turn
the
neighbors
into
"
spies
"
having
to
check
and
determine
whether
the
activity
was
permitted
or
not
.

Mr.
Warner
reiterated
that
persons
using
the
20
Free
Street
building
in
the
evenings
and
at
all
other
times
will
be
expected
to
respect
the
interests
of
neighbors
,
as
would
any
good
neighbor
.

The
Board
voted
to
attach
the
following
conditions
to
the
Special
Permit
A-3
:
1
.

A
4-foot
path
surfaced
with
a
"
nonpermanent

,
plowable
surface
such
as
brick
or
paving
stones
will
be
installed

April
2007

By
Jonathan
Romney

Outer
space
may
be
the
last
place
left
for
the
religious
impulse
in
cinema
.

Stanley	B	Stanley Kubrick	Stanley_Kubrick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick	000	000
Kubrick	I	Stanley Kubrick	Stanley_Kubrick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick	000	000
's
2001
was
the
first
film
to
equate
space
travel
and
the
spiritual
sublime
,
with
its
enigmatic
ages-of-man
ending
.

It
was
followed
by
Andrei	B	Andrei Tarkovsky	Andrei_Tarkovsky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky	000	000
Tarkovsky	I	Andrei Tarkovsky	Andrei_Tarkovsky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Tarkovsky	000	000
's
Solaris	B	Solaris	Solaris_(1972_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(1972_film)	000	000
which
,
though
ostensibly
set
somewhere
in
the
great
beyond
,
was
really
an
exploration
of
"
inner
space
"
,
of
love
,
memory
and
a
very
Russian	B	Russian	Russia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia	000	000
conception
of
the
soul
;
Steven	B	Steven Soderbergh	Steven_Soderbergh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Soderbergh	000	000
Soderbergh	I	Steven Soderbergh	Steven_Soderbergh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Soderbergh	000	000
recently
attempted
an
admirably
quixotic
remake
.

Other
,
more
strictly
generic
science-fiction
films
have
also
explored
an
awareness
that
's
not
necessarily
mystical
as
such
,
but
certainly
existential
,
depicting
space
travel
as
a
condition
of
desolation
and
exile
,
and
reminding
us
that
it
's
awfully
big
and
cold
out
there
:

.

Now
there
's
a
British	B	British	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
attempt
at
transcendental
sci-fi
:
Danny	B	Danny Boyle	Danny_Boyle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Boyle	000	000
Boyle	I	Danny Boyle	Danny_Boyle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Boyle	000	000

Garland	I	Alex Garland	Alex_Garland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Garland	000	000
,
his
collaborator
on
28
Days
Later
...
The
one-line
premise
:
set
the
controls
for
the
heart
of
the
sun
.

Fifty
years
hence
,
the
sun
is
dying
,
and
a
spaceship
loaded
with
explosives
has
headed
out
from
Earth	B	Earth	Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth	000	000
in
a
last-ditch
attempt
to
reboot
the
failing
star
.

The
vessel
,
somewhat
recklessly
,
has
been
named
Icarus
.

The
name
is
symbolic
not
just
for
the
mission
,
but
for
the
film
,
as
if
to
signal
that
Boyle	B	Boyle	Danny_Boyle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Boyle	000	000
and
Garland	B	Garland	Alex_Garland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Garland	000	000
are
also
working
with
impossibly
high
stakes
:
plucky
Brits
taking
on
a
big-scale
genre
project
,
an
undertaking
so
ambitious
that
they
too
risk
getting
their
wings
fried
.

All
in
all
,
the
film-makers
emerge
with
pinions
intact
:
I
do
n't
suppose
James	B	James Cameron	James_Cameron	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron	000	000
Cameron	I	James Cameron	James_Cameron	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron	000	000
or
Michael	B	Michael Bay	Michael_Bay	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bay	000	000
Bay	I	Michael Bay	Michael_Bay	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bay	000	000
will
feel
very
threatened
,
but
that
's
not
the
point
.

Narratively
,
Sunshine	B	Sunshine	Sunshine_(2007_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_(2007_film)	000	000
barely
convinces
,
but
it
does
lay
on
an
arresting
CGI	B	CGI	Computer-generated_imagery	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery	000	000
light
show
.

Early
on
,
one
of
the
astronauts
takes
an
unguarded
look
at
the
sun
,
a
revitalising
"
shower
in
light
"
,
even
though
Icarus
(
the
name
of
the
ship
's
talking
computer
as
well
as
the
vessel
itself
)
warns
of
"
irreversible
damage
to
the
retinas
.
"

You
may
well
worry
about
your
own
retinas
,
as
we
're
constantly
blasted
by
intense
light
of
assorted
digital
textures
:
up
close
,
the
sun
is
a
writhing
,
rustling
field
of
flame
,
the
universe
's
biggest
,
trippiest
lava
lamp
.

Director
of
photography
Alvin
Kuchler
also
explores
light
in
more
subtly
dazzling
ways
:
dust
motes
swim
in
a
green
haze
;
an
extreme
close-up
of
an
eye
reflects
colour
like
a
Christmas	B	Christmas	Christmas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas	000	000
bauble
.

As
in
Minority	B	Minority Report	Minority_Report_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)	000	000
Report	I	Minority Report	Minority_Report_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)	000	000
,
translucent
graphics
hang
shimmering
in
the
air
;
in
the
snappiest
piece
of
illusionism
,
the
ship
's
"
Earth
Room
"
displays
3D
images
of
the
Old
Planet
,
with
a
forest
on
one
wall
and
an
ocean
splashing
on
another
.

The
camera
hangs
rapturously
on
gleaming
golden
surfaces
,
such
as
the
bulbous
spacesuits
,
and
an
umbrella-like
canopy
made
of
a
million
shifting
leaves
.

But
all
this
can
be
overpowering
,
and
it
comes
as
a
welcome
relief
when
the
film
plunges
us
into
the
dark
,
as
the
astronauts
explore
a
dead
,
dust-filled
spaceship
.

Not
only
do
our
eyes
get
a
rest
,
but
Sunshine	B	Sunshine	Sunshine_(2007_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_(2007_film)	000	000
's
brash
hyper-modernity
also
takes
a
breather
,
as
it
veers
into
old-fashioned
adventure
.

Entering
the
ghost
ship
,
one
character
jokes
,
"
We
might
get
picked
off
one
by
one
by
aliens
.
"

Perhaps
this
line
represents
a
moment
of
self-conscious
decadence
in
the
genre
:
a
science-fiction
film
in
which
the
characters
have
watched
Alien	B	Alien	Alien_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)	000	000
.

Sunshine	B	Sunshine	Sunshine_(2007_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_(2007_film)	000	000
certainly
knows
its
antecedents
and
does
n't
attempt
to
hide
its
debt
.

The
voice
of
Icarus
is
a
female
cousin
to
2001
's
HAL	B	HAL	HAL_9000	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000	000	000
,
even
shifting
down
a
couple
of
octaves
,
like
his
,
in
a
moment
of
crisis
.

The
spaceship
's
oxygen-making
mini-rainforest
also
echoes
Silent	B	Silent Running	Silent_Running	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Running	000	000
Running	I	Silent Running	Silent_Running	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Running	000	000
.

But
you
do
get
a
disturbing
sense
of
a
genre
having
run
out
of
new
narrative
ideas
:
you
feel
the
film
is
less
about
the
last
gasp
of
the
sun
,
than
that
of
space-travel
cinema
itself
.

Despite
its
dreamy
beginnings
,
much
of
the
film
opts
traditionally
for
action
rather
than
awe
.

Malfunctions
pile
up
,
human
errors
get
made
,
crisis
follows
nail-biting
crisis
.

But
there
's
so
little
going
on
in
terms
of
character
that
you
barely
care
when
terrible
fates
befall
the
crew
members
.

but

never
really
know

are

touches
that
really
signify
are
somewhat
crude
:

makes
a
noble
sacrifice

's
religious
dimension
explicitly
re-emerges
when
the
mission
's
success
is
endangered
by
a
fanatic
who
's
been
out
in
space
too
long
and
wants
to
be
"
alone
with
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
.
"

The
presence
of
the
Sublime
is
signalled
in
the
finale
by
juddering
discontinuity
in
the
editing
,
and
an
image
stretched
as
though
the
projectionist
had
suddenly
switched
lenses
.

The
presence
of
the
Almighty	B	Almighty	Bruce_Almighty	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Almighty	000	000
,
or
just
an
almighty
headache
?

Decide
for
yourself
.

I
ca
n't
help
feeling
that
a
simple
burning
bush
might
have
been
more
affecting
than
this
all-out
forest
fire
.

's
Father
's
Day
Gift
to
You
and
Your
Dad

By
Mavis
Baah

President
Barack	B	Barack Obama	Barack_Obama	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama	000	000
Obama	I	Barack Obama	Barack_Obama	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama	000	000
wears
several
different
hats
,
but
he
says
his
most
important
role
is
being
a
father
to
Malia	B	Malia	Malia,_Crete	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malia,_Crete	000	000
,
12
,
and
Sasha	B	Sasha	Sasha_(DJ)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasha_(DJ)	000	000
,
10
.

Raised
by
a
single
mom
,
the
President
has
always
been
vocal
about
how
important
it
is
for
men
to
step
up
as
fathers
,
particularly
in
the
African-American	B	African-American	African_American	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American	000	000
community
.

The
White
House
is
acknowledging
the
negative
impact
a
father
’s
absence
has
on
children
,
and
that
even
those
fathers
who
are
active
in
their
children
’s
lives
sometimes
need
support
.

This
week
,
the
White
House
kicked
off
the
“
Strong
Fathers
,
Strong
Families
”
initiative
to
make
this
time
of
the
year
special

dads

and
Groupon	B	Groupon	Groupon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupon	000	000
to
offer
discounts
for
certain
events
so
that
fathers
can
spend
more
quality
time
with
their
families
.

will
host
movie
screenings
for

throughout
the
year
.

Yesterday
,
military

and

joined
the

for

House	I	White House	White_House	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House	000	000
will
honor
12
dads
from
around
the
country
who
are
committed
to
providing
for
their
children
and
positively
impacting
their
communities
.

From
the
Heart
:
The
President
penned
an
op-ed
in
People	B	People magazine	People_(magazine)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)	000	000
magazine	I	People magazine	People_(magazine)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)	000	000
that
described
his
relationship
with
his
children
.

He
wrote
,
“
I
've
learned
that
children
do
n't
just
need
us
physically
present
,
but
emotionally
available
--
willing
to
listen
and
pay
attention
and
participate
in
their
daily
lives
.
”

President
Obama	B	Obama	Barack_Obama	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama	000	000
knows
that
one
of
the
best
ways
to
encourage
fathers
to
take
responsibility
is
to
set
an
example
.

He
connects
with
his
daughters
by
eating
dinner
with
his
family
most
nights
of
the
week
,
and
even
serving
as
an
assistant
coach
for
Sasha	B	Sasha	Sasha_(DJ)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasha_(DJ)	000	000
’s
basketball
team

Executive
Summary

Scientists
expect
that
global
warming
will
cause
a
variety
of
changes
to
precipitation
patterns
in
the
United	B	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
States	I	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
.

Many
areas
will
receive
increased
amounts
of
rain
and
snow
over
the
course
of
a
year
;
some
areas
will
receive
less
.

But
scientists
expect
that
,
all
across
the
country
,
the
rainstorms
and
snowstorms
that
do
occur
will
be
more
intense
--
increasing
the
risk
of
flooding
and
other
impacts
.

In
this
report
,
we
evaluate
trends
in
the
frequency
of
storms
with
extreme
levels
of
rainfall
or
snowfall
across
the
contiguous	B	contiguous United States	Contiguous_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States	000	000
United	I	contiguous United States	Contiguous_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States	000	000
States	I	contiguous United States	Contiguous_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States	000	000
over
the
last
60
years
.

We
analyze
daily
precipitation
records
spanning
from
1948
through
2006
at
more
than
3,000
weather
stations
in
48
states
.

We
then
examine
patterns
in
the
timing
of
heavy
precipitation
relative
to
the
local
climate
at
each
weather
station
.

We
find
that
storms
with
extreme
amounts
of
rain
or
snowfall
are
happening
more
often
across
most
of
America	B	America	North_America	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America	000	000
,
consistent
with
the
predicted
impact
of
global
warming
.

Scientists
expect
global
warming
to
increase
the
frequency
of
heavy
precipitation
.

As
the
earth
warms
,
temperate
regions
of
North	B	North America	North_America	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America	000	000
America	I	North America	North_America	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America	000	000
will
face
a
growing
risk
of
storms
with
extreme
levels
of
rain
or
snowfall
.

Global
warming
increases
the
intensity
of
precipitation
in
two
key
ways
.

First
,
by
increasing
the
temperature
of
the
land
and
the
oceans
,
global
warming
causes
water
to
evaporate
faster
.

Second
,
by
increasing
air
temperature
,
global
warming
enables
the
atmosphere
to
hold
more
water
vapor
.

These
factors
combine
to
make
clouds
richer
with
moisture
,
making
heavy
downpours
or
snowstorms
more
likely
.

The
consequences
of
increasingly
intense
rainstorms
may
include
flooding
,
crop
damage
,
pollution
of
waterways
with
runoff
,
erosion
,
and
other
environmental
and
economic
damage
.

During
the
20th
century
,
floods
caused
more
property
damage
and
loss
of
life
than
any
other
natural
disaster
in
the
United	B	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
States	I	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
.

An
increase
in
the
number
of
downpours
does
not
necessarily
mean
more
water
will
be
available
.

Scientists
expect
that
extreme
downpours
will
punctuate
longer
periods
of
relative
dryness
,
increasing
the
risk
of
drought
.

In
the
Southwest	B	Southwest	Southwestern_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States	000	000
,
for
example
,
total
annual
precipitation
is
projected
to
decline
--
amplifying
the
impact
of
periods
of
little
rainfall
between
heavy
storms
.

Even
in
the
rest
of
the
country
,
where
total
annual
precipitation
is
expected
to
increase
,
more
of
that
precipitation
will
fall
in
heavy
rainstorms
or
snowstorms
,
paradoxically
increasing
the
potential
for
drought
.

As
temperatures
rise
,
precipitation
will
become
increasingly
likely
to
fall
as
rain
rather
than
snow
,
increasing
runoff
and
likely
reducing
water
supplies
in
areas
dependent
on
snowpack

records
show
that
storms
with
extreme
precipitation
have
become
more
frequent
over
the
last
60
years
.

Consistent
with
the
predicted
impacts
of
global
warming
,
we
found
that
storms
with
extreme
precipitation
have
increased
in
frequency
by
24

These
findings
are
consistent
with
previous
studies
of
extreme
precipitation
patterns
,
both
in
the
United
States
and
across
the
globe
.

For
example
:

Scientists
have
observed
warmer
weather
,
higher
atmospheric
moisture
content
,
increased
formation
of
storm
clouds
,
and
an
increase
in
thunderstorm
activity
over
the
contiguous	B	contiguous United States	Contiguous_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States	000	000
United	I	contiguous United States	Contiguous_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States	000	000
States	I	contiguous United States	Contiguous_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States	000	000
in
recent
decades
.

In
1999
,
researchers
at
the
Illinois
State
Water
Survey
and
the
National	B	National Climatic Data Center	National_Climatic_Data_Center	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Climatic_Data_Center	000	000

Center	I	National Climatic Data Center	National_Climatic_Data_Center	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Climatic_Data_Center	000	000
(
NCDC	B	NCDC	National_Climatic_Data_Center	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Climatic_Data_Center	000	000
)
found
that
storms
with
extreme
precipitation
became
more
frequent
by
about
3
percent
per
decade
from
1931
to
1996
.

Our
findings
are
consistent
with
this
result
.

In
2004
,
scientists
at
NCDC	B	NCDC	National_Climatic_Data_Center	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Climatic_Data_Center	000	000
concluded
that
most
of
the
observed
increase
in
storms
with
heavy
and
very
heavy
precipitation
levels
since
the
early
1900s
had
occurred
in
the
last
three
decades
.

In
other
words
,
they
found
that
the
change
in
extreme
precipitation
frequency
is
unusual
and
relatively
recent
.

Moreover
,
NCDC	B	NCDC	National_Climatic_Data_Center	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Climatic_Data_Center	000	000
found
that
extremely
heavy
storms
are
increasing
in
frequency
more
rapidly
than
very
heavy
storms
--
which
in
turn
are
increasing
in
frequency
more
rapidly
than
heavy
storms
.

The
severity
of
the
trend
toward
more
intense
downpours
in
the
future
depends
upon
our
emissions
of
the
pollution
that
drives
global
warming
.

Climate
models
predict
that
the
trend
toward
increasingly
frequent
storms
with
heavy
precipitation
will
intensify
in
the
future
.

Some
amount
of
change
is
inevitable
given
the
global
warming
emissions
humans
have
already
created
.

However
,
we
still
have
the
ability
to
prevent
the
worst-case
scenarios
.

By
halting
the
increase
in
total
US	B	US	Contiguous_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States	000	000
global
warming
emissions
now
and
reducing
emissions
by
at
least
80
percent
by
mid-century
,
we
can
limit
the
increase
in
major
storm
frequency
--
and
thus
reduce
future
risks
of
flooding
and
other
serious
consequences
of
extreme
rainstorms
.

To
address
global
warming
,
America	B	America	North_America	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America	000	000
should
limit
emissions
of
global
warming
pollution
,
while
improving
energy
efficiency
and
increasing
the
use
of
renewable
energy
.

To
protect
future
generations
,
the
United	B	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
States	I	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
should
adopt
a
mandatory
cap
on
global
warming
pollution
that
reduces
total
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
emissions
by
at
least
15
to
20
percent
by
2020
and
by
at
least
80
percent
by
2050
.

If
policymakers
choose
a
cap-and-trade
program
to
achieve
this
goal
,
it
should
include
auctioning
100
percent
of
emission
allowances
,
rather
than
giving
allowances
away
to
polluters
.

By
auctioning
allowances
,
we
can
reduce
the
cost
of
achieving
emission
reduction
goals
,
making
it
more
likely
that
America	B	America	North_America	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America	000	000
will
succeed
.

The
United	B	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
States	I	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
should
also
adopt
complementary
policies
to
improve
energy
efficiency
and
increase
the
use
of
clean
,
renewable
energy
.

The

top
8
health
stories
of
2008

The
year
’s
top
10
list
is
a
reminder
that
so
much
of
health

and
medicine
seems
to
reside
stubbornly
in
the
details
.

1
.

Blood
sugar
limbo
:
How
low
should
it
go
?

People
with
type
2
diabetes
are
encouraged
to
keep
their

blood
sugar
levels
low
,
and
the
usual
goal
is
a
glycated
hemoglobin
(
HbA1c	B	HbA1c	Glycated_hemoglobin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin	000	000
)

level
of
7
%
or
lower
.

But
is
7
%
ambitious
enough
?

Results
from
three
clinical

trials
showed
that
the
single-minded
pursuit
of
low
blood
sugar
levels
is

probably
not
the
best
approach
to
type
2
diabetes
,
particularly
in
people
ages

60
and
older
.

People
with
diabetes
should
not
give
up
blood
sugar

control
.

Data
show
that
it
lowers
the
risk
of
kidney
disorders
,
eye
disorders
,

and
other
problems
related
to
damage
of
small
blood
vessels
(
microvascular

disease
)
.

But
2008
’s
bumper
crop
of
diabetes
research
has
shown
that

it
’s
unwise
to
be
overzealous
about
blood
sugar
lowering
--
moderation
in
all

things
!

--
and
certainly
not
without
also
attending
to
risk
factors
like
high

blood
pressure
and
cholesterol
.

2
.

80
ai
n’t
old

The
age
limit
for
controlling
high
blood
pressure
--
usually

with
medication
--
has
crept
up
as
research
results
have
shown
that
it
prevents

strokes
,
heart
attacks
,
and
heart
failure
in
the
old
and
young
alike
.

Results
from
the
Hypertension
in
the
Very
Elderly
Trial

(
HYVET
)
topped
off
that
trend
by
showing
that
for
those
80
and
older
reining
in

high
blood
pressure
pays
off
.

After
two
years
,
the
treated
group
in
the
study

had
lower
rates
of
heart
failure
,
strokes
,
and
overall
mortality
,
which
was

especially
important
because
previous
research
suggested
a
decrease
in
strokes

might
be
offset
by
an
increase
in
deaths
from
other
causes
.

HYVET
is
more
evidence
that
the
age
for
effective
medical

intervention
--
be
it
pills
,
surgery
,
or
devices
--
is
getting
older
and
older
.

Gene
tests
:
Progress
and
Pandora
’s
box

In
2008
,
personalized
medicine
(
or
pharmacogenomics
,
as
it

is
sometimes
called
if
drug
choices
are
involved
)
inched
closer
to
becoming

part
of
everyday
medicine
.

Doctors
have
started
to
order
gene
tests
to
assess

how
sensitive
people
are
to
warfarin
(
Coumadin	B	Coumadin	Warfarin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warfarin	000	000
)
,
the
anti
--
blood
clotting
drug
.

Researchers
reported
that
heart-failure
patients
with
a
certain
genetic
profile

responded
well
to
bucindolol
,
a
beta
blocker
that
had
fallen
out
of
favor

because
it
was
n’t
very
effective
in
the
average
patient
.

And
results
from
a

substudy
of
a
large
blood
pressure
trial
traced
differences
in
the
response
to

diuretics
back
to
a
particular
gene
.

Meanwhile
,
many
direct-to-the-consumer
genetic
tests
hit
the

market
.

Several
companies
are
using
the
same
DNA
chips
as
researchers
to
sell

genome
scans
,
readouts
of
several
hundred
thousand
genetic
variations
that
have
been
associated
with
diseases
and

other
traits
.

The
commercial
tests
have
raised
some
concerns
.

Will
they
be

done
correctly
?

And
even
if
they
are
,
at
this
stage
,
the
predictive
powers
may

be
oversold
,
unduly
scaring
some
while
giving
false
assurances
to
others
.

Moreover
,
the
take-home
message
would
be
the
same
:
lose
weight
,
exercise
,
eat

more
fruit
and
vegetables
.

.

Seeing
right
through
you
and
its
dangers

A
half-dozen
imaging
technologies
allow
doctors
to
see

what
’s
going
on
inside
the
body
.

The
workhorse
,
though
,
is
computed
tomography

(
CT	B	CT	X-ray_computed_tomography	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography	000	000
)
,
which
uses
a
computer
to
assemble
multiple
cross-sectional
x-rays
into

remarkably
detailed
pictures
.

A
new
generation
of
machines
,
called

multidetector
CT
scanners
,
are
making
the
pictures
even
faster
and
incredibly

sharp
.

By
some
estimates
,
doctors
in
the
United	B	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
States	I	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
ordered
over
60

million
CT
scans
this
year
,
double
the
number
ordered
in
the
late
1990s
.

But
are
we
going
to
pay
a
price
for
all
these
pictures
?

The

radiation
from
CT
scans
is
much
higher
than
from
traditional
imaging
tests
.

Starting
in
2007
and
continuing
into
2008
,
researchers
at
Columbia	B	Columbia University	Columbia_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University	000	000
University	I	Columbia University	Columbia_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University	000	000

have
published
several
provocative
papers
about
the
cancers
that
these
CT
scans

may
cause
.

According
to
their
projections
,
our
current
exposure
to
CT
scans

might
be
responsible
for
between
1.5
%
and
2
%
of
all
cancers
a
few
decades
from

now
(
it
takes
years
for
the
cancers
to
develop
)
.

Doctors
need
to
eliminate
unnecessary
do-overs
.

And
using

other
imaging
tests
when
possible
could
reduce
radiation
exposure
.

War
wounds
that
do
n’t
show

One
of
the
grim
aspects
of
the
wars
in
Iraq	B	Iraq	Iraq	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq	000	000
and
Afghanistan	B	Afghanistan	Afghanistan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan	000	000
has
been
the
widespread

use
of
small-scale
bombs
--
in
military
jargon
,
improvised
explosive
devices

(
IEDs
)
--
in
suicide
attacks
and
roadside
booby
traps
.

Many
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
soldiers

survive
these
explosions
because
of
protective
gear
,
but
by
no
means
do
they

escape
unscathed
.

In
addition
to
terrible
leg
,
arm
,
and
other
sorts
of
obvious

physical
injury
,
there
are
brain
injuries
that
may
have
long-lasting
effects
.

reported
the
results
of
a
study
that
counted
the
number
of
mild
traumatic
brain

injuries
--
or
,
more
simply
put
,
concussions
--
among
returning
troops
.

About
15
%

(
384
of
2,525
)
gave
answers
that
suggested
they
had
suffered
a
mild
traumatic

brain
injury
of
some
kind
.

Probing
a
bit
further
,
the
Walter	B	Walter Reed	Walter_Reed_Army_Institute_of_Research	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reed_Army_Institute_of_Research	000	000
Reed	I	Walter Reed	Walter_Reed_Army_Institute_of_Research	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reed_Army_Institute_of_Research	000	000
researchers

found
that
almost
half
(
54
of
123
)
of
the
soldiers
whose
concussions
had
caused

a
loss
of
consciousness
met
the
criteria
for
post-traumatic
stress
disorder

(
PTSD	B	PTSD	Posttraumatic_stress_disorder	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder	000	000
)
,
and
about
a
quarter
of
them
were
suffering
from
major
depression
.

It
’s
difficult
to
separate
the
concussions
suffered
in
a
war

from
the
life-threatening
stress
under
which
they
occur
.

The
Army	B	Army	United_States_Army	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army	000	000
researchers

believe
that
there
’s
a
great
deal
of
overlap
between
PTSD	B	PTSD	Posttraumatic_stress_disorder	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posttraumatic_stress_disorder	000	000
and
the
ill-defined

consequences
of
wartime
concussions
.

Regardless
if
the
cause
is
stress
,

concussion
,
or
some
mixture
,
the
veterans
of
these
wars
who
have
memory

problems
,
difficulty
concentrating
,
headaches
,
and
other
“
invisible
”
injuries

must
get
the
care
they
need
and
deserve
.

Generic
Rx
:
Shopping
for
health
care
in
the
global
village

Once
the
exception
,
generic
drugs
are
now
the
norm
.

In
2008
,

about
two-thirds
of
the
prescriptions
written
by
doctors
were
for
generic

drugs
.

Generic
drugs
have
taken
off
for
many
reasons
.

Brand-name

blockbusters
(
Fosamax	B	Fosamax	Alendronic_acid	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alendronic_acid	000	000
,
Pravachol	B	Pravachol	Pravastatin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravastatin	000	000

,
Zoloft	B	Zoloft	Sertraline	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertraline	000	000
)
have
lost
their
patent

protection
in
recent
years
.

Cost
shifting
by
insurers
and
tiered
pricing
have

steered
doctors
and
their
patients
to
the
generic
script
.

Large
retailers
like

Wal-Mart	B	Wal-Mart	Walmart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart	000	000
have
used
generics
as
loss
leaders
simply
to
get
people
into
their

stores
.

And
the
Medicare	B	Medicare Part D	Medicare_Part_D	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Part_D	000	000
Part	I	Medicare Part D	Medicare_Part_D	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Part_D	000	000
D	I	Medicare Part D	Medicare_Part_D	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Part_D	000	000
prescription
plans
have
loaded
up
their

formularies
with
generics
with
only
a
sprinkling
of
brand-name
drugs
in
between
.

But
a
crucial
,
and
largely
underappreciated
,
factor
has
been

the
role
of
low-cost
suppliers
,
many
of
them
in
India	B	India	India	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India	000	000
.

All
the
problems
with

contaminated
Chinese	B	Chinese	China	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China	000	000
products
do
n’t
need
to
be
recounted
here
.

So
far
,
nothing

as
serious
has
occurred
with
Indian	B	Indian	India	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India	000	000
drugs
,
although
the
FDA	B	FDA	Food_and_Drug_Administration	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration	000	000
has
promised
to

step
up
its
overseas
inspections
.

Awareness
test
does
n’t
make
the
grade

Being
awake
during
surgery
after
being
given
general

anesthesia
is
one
of
those
bad
dreams
that
does
,
very
occasionally
,
come
true
.

Several
studies
have
found
“
anesthesia
awareness
”
to
be
a
1-in-1
,000

occurrence
,
although
one
study
put
it
more
in
the
hen
’s
teeth
territory
of
1
in

15,000
.

The
bispectral
index
(
BIS	B	BIS	Reinforcement_sensitivity_theory	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_sensitivity_theory	000	000
)
is
a
formula
that
uses
the
values
of

measurements
of
the
brain
’s
electrical
activity
to
come
up
with
a
single
number

that
’s
supposed
to
measure
“
anesthetic
depth
.
”

But
it
’s
been
controversial
,

partly
because
the
company
that
sells
it
has
kept
the
formula
a
proprietary

secret
.

reported
the
results
of
a
study

that
tested
the
BIS	B	BIS	Reinforcement_sensitivity_theory	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_sensitivity_theory	000	000
monitoring
in
a
2,000-person
randomized
trial
.

Four
people

in
the
study
experienced
anesthesia
awareness
,
two
in
the
BIS	B	BIS	Reinforcement_sensitivity_theory	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_sensitivity_theory	000	000
-
monitored
group

and
two
in
the
control
group
,
and
five
others
were
rated
as
possibly
being

awake
during
their
operations
(
false
memories
can
occur
)
,
four
in
the

BIS	B	BIS	Reinforcement_sensitivity_theory	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_sensitivity_theory	000	000
-
monitored
group
and
one
in
the
control
group
.

The
investigators
concluded

that
BIS	B	BIS	Reinforcement_sensitivity_theory	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_sensitivity_theory	000	000
-
guided
anesthesia
was
no
better
at
identifying
anesthesia
awareness

than
another
kind
of
monitoring
.

This
is
another
case
when
the
results
of
an
independent

clinical
trial
have
called
into
question
the
value
of
a
widely
adopted
medical

practice
.

Health
care
reform
:
If
not
soon
,
when
?

Some
argue
that
the
new
political
leadership
will
be
hard

pressed
to
take
on
something
so
organizationally
and
politically
complicated
as

health
care
reform
during
an
economic
downturn
.

The
counterpoint
:
health
care

reform
is
essential
for
any
kind
of
durable
recovery
.

Regardless
of
how
reform
efforts
play
out
in
the
long
run
,

here
are
a
few
,
quite
gloomy
predictions

about
the
short
term
:

The
health
care
building
boom
will
wind
down
in

2009
.

The
number
of
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
without
health
insurance

will
increase
as
the
economy
sheds
jobs
and
employers
look
for
ways
to
cut

costs
.

The
ranks
of
the
underinsured
--
people
with
bare-bones
policies

with
exclusions
and
high
deductibles
--
will
grow
.

Investment
in
projects
that
might
save

money
in
the
long
run
and
make
health
care
more
efficient
--
electronic
medical

records
,
prevention
programs
,
and
the
like
--
will
be
put
off
during
the

scramble
to
make
ends
meet
.

So
let
’s
hope
the

short
term
is
just
that
,
and
that
we
are
soon
able
to
find
the
political
skill

and
will
to
contain
the
costs
of
health
care
while
also
extending
coverage
to

47
million
uninsured

Television
liberalisation
makes
further
inroads
into
francophone
Africa	B	Africa	West_Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa	000	000

Issue

Two
recent
developments
in
francophone
Africa	B	Africa	West_Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa	000	000
have
set
the
stage
for
wider
broadcast
liberalisation
.

Firstly
,
the
Ivorian	B	Ivorian	Ivory_Coast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast	000	000
Minister
of
Communication
has
received
a
study
recommending
opening
up
the
market
.

Secondly
,
Africa	B	Africa	West_Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa	000	000
’s
newest
Pay	B	Pay TV	Pay_television	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_television	000	000
TV	I	Pay TV	Pay_television	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_television	000	000
contender
GTV
fired
its
opening
shots
in
the
battle
to
win
a
significant
chunk
of
subscribers
in
francophone
markets
.

Russell
Southwood
looks
at
what
’s
happening
.

Cote	B	Cote d'Ivoire	Ivory_Coast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast	000	000
d'Ivoire	I	Cote d'Ivoire	Ivory_Coast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast	000	000
liberalised
the
press
in
1990
but
up
until
now
there
have
only
been
two
“
Free-To-Air
”
public
television
channels
:
La
Première
et
TV2
.

This
is
all
set
change
with
the
delivery
of
report
by
French	B	French	France	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France	000	000
consulting
company
Media
Consulting
Group
(
MCG	B	MCG	Melbourne_Cricket_Ground	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground	000	000
)
to
the
Minister	B	Minister of Communications	Minister_of_Communications_(South_Africa)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Communications_(South_Africa)	000	000
of	I	Minister of Communications	Minister_of_Communications_(South_Africa)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Communications_(South_Africa)	000	000
Communications	I	Minister of Communications	Minister_of_Communications_(South_Africa)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Communications_(South_Africa)	000	000
,
Ibrahim
Sy
Savané
.

The
report
recommends
a
“
prudent
”
opening
up
of
the
sector
“
to
permit
the
achievement
of
the
growth
of
the
televisual
offer
,
and
to
reinforce
public
debate
by
creating
new
spaces
for
citizenship
,
and
to
create
the
conditions
for
a
national
industry
of
programme-making
.
”

The
report
envisages
liberalisation
happening
in
stages
:
”
step-by-step
liberalisation
with
the
first
step
being
the
creation
of
two
private
,
Free-To-Air
channels
,
whose
coverage
area
would
be
restricted
to
(
the
capital
)
Abidjan	B	Abidjan	Abidjan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abidjan	000	000
and
its
immediate
environs
before
later
being
extended
nationally
.
”

This
would
mean
that
four
TV
channels
would
be
relying
on
the
local
advertising
market
for
financing
.

Cote	B	Cote d'Ivoire	Ivory_Coast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast	000	000
d'Ivoire	I	Cote d'Ivoire	Ivory_Coast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast	000	000
was
once
one
of
the
lion
economies
of
West	B	West Africa	West_Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa	000	000
Africa	I	West Africa	West_Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa	000	000
but
the
impact
of
the
recent
civil
has
cut
back
economic
growth
.

However
,
if
the
current
peace
holds
,
then
the
rather
tentative
liberalisation
suggested
may
turn
out
to
be
quite
conservative
.

The
report
lays
out
the
requirements
of
a
liberalised
market
in
policy
and
regulatory
terms
,
including
the
necessity
to
strengthen
both
regulation
and
self-regulation
in
the
industry
.

The
creation
of
the
two
new
channels
should
be
open
to
tender
(
un
cahier
des
charges
)
which
defined
the
future
obligations
of
these
new
operators
in
terms
of
news
and
the
inclusion
of
both
Ivorian	B	Ivorian	Ivory_Coast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast	000	000
and
African	B	African	Sub-Saharan_Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa	000	000
programmes
.

The
report
’s
authors
were
keen
to
emphasise
the
need
to
safeguard
Ivorian	B	Ivorian	Ivory_Coast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast	000	000
national
identity
.

But
according
to
the
report
:
”
Cote	B	Cote d'Ivoire	Ivory_Coast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast	000	000
d'Ivoire	I	Cote d'Ivoire	Ivory_Coast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast	000	000
,
as
many
other
African	B	African	Sub-Saharan_Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa	000	000
countries
,
already
has
a
lively
global
competition
in
terms
of
cable
television
.
”

The
MCG	B	MCG	Melbourne_Cricket_Ground	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground	000	000
study
was
financed
by
the
European	B	European Union	European_Union	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union	000	000
Union	I	European Union	European_Union	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union	000	000
and
is
aimed
at
provided
the
Government
with
a
tool
for
decision-making
.

It
remains
to
be
seen
whether
Minister
Ibrahim
Sy
Savané
will
accept
the
report
’s
recommendations
.

With
the
country
’s
current
political
difficulties
,
all
media
policy
choices
--
particularly
over
new
media
entrants
--
will
be
exceptionally
political
.

Meanwhile
Pay
TV
channel
GTV
announced
its
intention
earlier
this
month
to
expand
its
operations
into
francophone
Africa.The
new
French	B	French	France	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France	000	000
service
promises
channels
and
content
specifically
targeted
to
French	B	French	France	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France	000	000
speaking
viewers
.

The
new
service
includes
tailor-made
new
packages
designed
for
family
TV
viewing
.

Channels
will
include
African	B	African	Sub-Saharan_Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa	000	000
-
produced
content
,
blockbuster
international
series
and
sitcoms
,
kids
entertainment
,
religious
and
educational/documentaries
.

The
service
will
offer
an
entry-level
package
as
well
as
a
premium
package
,
which
will
include
up
to
10
live
Barclays	B	Barclays Premier League	Premier_League	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League	000	000
Premier	I	Barclays Premier League	Premier_League	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League	000	000
League	I	Barclays Premier League	Premier_League	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League	000	000
games
per
week
.

GTV
will
shortly
be
launching
in
the
DRC	B	DRC	Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo	000	000
,
Cameroon	B	Cameroon	Cameroon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon	000	000
,
Cote	B	Cote D'Ivoire	Ivory_Coast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast	000	000
D'Ivoire	I	Cote D'Ivoire	Ivory_Coast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory_Coast	000	000
,
Gabon	B	Gabon	Gabon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabon	000	000
,
Senegal	B	Senegal	Senegal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal	000	000

Brazzaville	I	Congo Brazzaville	Republic_of_the_Congo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_the_Congo	000	000
,
Togo	B	Togo	Togo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togo	000	000
and
Benin	B	Benin	Benin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin	000	000
.

The
first
of
these
new
services
started
on
16
August
.

The
launch
of
these
new
services
at
least
provides
some
much
needed
competition
for
the
near
monopoly
of
Vivendi	B	Vivendi	Vivendi	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi	000	000
-
owned
Canal	B	Canal Plus	Canal+	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal+	000	000
Plus	I	Canal Plus	Canal+	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal+	000	000
.

It
has
kept
bouquet
prices
high
and
has
in
a
number
of
countries
suffered
severe
problems
with
piracy
.

Although
it
does
not
report
its
African	B	African	Sub-Saharan_Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa	000	000
subscription
numbers
separately
,
Balancing
Act
estimates
that
its
Sub-Saharan	B	Sub-Saharan African	Sub-Saharan_Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa	000	000
African	I	Sub-Saharan African	Sub-Saharan_Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa	000	000
subscribers
number
around
200,000
.

summary
anyone
?

Grave_Addiction06-24-2005
,
12:53
PMIt
can
be
kind
of
hard
to
hear
Reggie
at
times
,
so
I
typed
up
the
entire
clip
as
best
I
could
.

As
you
can
see
,
Revolution	B	Revolution	Wii	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii	000	000
will
more
than
hold
its
own
in
graphical
performance
.

What
we
also
know
is
that
what
you
publishers
and
developers
see
when
you
look
at
the
spec
sheet
of
our
competitor
's
new
systems
.

Larger
budgets
,
higher
staffing
,
steeper
learning
curve
and
longer
production
schedules
.

Nintendo	B	Nintendo Revolution	Wii	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii	000	000
Revolution	I	Nintendo Revolution	Wii	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii	000	000
is
designed
to
be
none
of
these
.

Our
conscious
decision
was
to
take
a
different
path
.

Revolution
will
be
the
home
to
stunning
new
game
masterpieces
from
Nintendo
and
our
third
parties
.

In
fact
,
the
balance
built
into
Revolution	B	Revolution	Wii	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii	000	000
makes
it
the
perfect
choice
to
achieve
your
highest
creative
goals
.

But
if
your
budgets
are
a
little
more
(
motto
?
)

,
I
would
recommend
to
also
envision
the
creation
of
much
better
game
experiences
with
much
less
hassle
.

We
expect
the
time
frame
needed
to
make
Nintendo
's
Revolution	B	Revolution	Wii	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii	000	000
game
to
be
substantially
shorter
than
all
of
our
competitors
.

In
effect
,
we
see
Revolution	B	Revolution	Wii	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii	000	000
to
be
the
best
new
console
for
game
developing
partners
no
matter
what
type
of
game
you
're
making
.

Finally
for
all
of
our
retail
partners
,
I
can
hear
you
whispering
under
your
breaths
,
"
Do
n't
tell
me
about
developing
games
,
just
tell
me
what
games
you
're
gon
na
deliver
.
"

Well
,
let
's
talk
about
that
.

First
,
we
expect
the
great
third-party
support
we
now
have
on
Gamecube	B	Gamecube	GameCube	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube	000	000
to
be
both
stronger
and
earlier
on
the
Revolution	B	Revolution	Wii	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii	000	000
.

And
we
will
be
more
aggressive
than
ever
in
having
our
own
new
in-house
stars
,
the
greatest
gathering
of
(
byte-sized
characters
?
)

in
history
by
as
early
as
possible
.

You
can
expect
new
Nintendo
intelluctual
properties
in
the
launch
window
.

Our
franchise
stars
are
about
to
make
some
new
friends
.

And
you
should
know
that
development
of
new
Revolution
titles
is
already
underway
.

PMnew
game
*
could
n't
understand
what
he
was
saying
here
*
from
Nintendo
and
our
third
parties
.

He
said
"
masterpieces
.
"

That
's
all
I
have
to
add
.

Now
,
where
did
this
come
from
?

This
speech
?

I
mean
it
sounds
like
we
've
only
got
about
the
last
half
of
this
speech
.

It
's
apparent
that
at
some
point
he
must
have
been
discussing
raw
graphical
power
.
"

It
will
more
than
hold
its
own
.
"

That
makes
feel
a
bit
better
about
that
issue
,
but
it
is
Reggie
,
meaning
I
know
it
's
his
job
to
hype
...
He
mentions
competitor
spec
sheets
as
if
he
has
something
comparable
to
them
right
now
(
i.e.
,
as
he
's
talking
to
these
people
)
.

There
's
got
to
be
some
information
on
this
somewhere
.

I
need
some
serious
reassurance
about
the
graphics
,
and
it
sounds
like
this
could
be
the
first
indication
that
the
power
issue
is
about
to
be
put
to
rest
.

I
mean
,
if
all
the
systems
are
within
10
%
or
so
of
each
other
in
terms
of
raw
power
,
then
the
graphics
debate
is
dead
.

Put
the
best
graphical
games
of
all
three
systems
now
,
and
you
can
barely
tell
a
true
difference
.

I
assume
it
's
going
to
be
exactly
the
same
for
the
next
generation
.

Of
course
,
that
's
just
all
my
speculation
.

PMSounds
good
.

I
want
to
see
Kid	B	Kid Icarus	Kid_Icarus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Icarus	000	000
Icarus	I	Kid Icarus	Kid_Icarus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Icarus	000	000
back
!

I
think
Nintendo
has
a
good
idea
with
giving
developers
an
easier
task
.

It
would
be
nice
to
see
the
Revolution	B	Revolution	Wii	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii	000	000
get
really
solid
3rd
party
support
.

I
would
n't
mind
seeing
some
of
the
things
that
the
XBOX	B	XBOX	Xbox_(console)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)	000	000
and
the
PS2	B	PS2	PlayStation_2	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2	000	000
got
such
as
Street
Fighter
Anniversary
Collection
(
online
)
as
long
as
there
done
right
.

The
N64	B	N64	Nintendo_64	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64	000	000
and
the
Cube	B	Cube	GameCube	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameCube	000	000
had
great
games
but
lacked
in
pure
numbers
of
titles
.

With
this
new
approach
they
may
be
able
to
swing
some
back
their
way
.

Anxiously
awaiting
this
console
.

?

Is
it
that
important
to
you
?

Finally
--
Have
a
conversation
,
not
a
fight

That
's
from
one
of
the
NOA
people
in
their
forums
.

So
with
the
list
going
around
,
if
you
really
want
it
,
have
it
signed
.

As
they
said
,
anything
can
change
.

MorPhiend07-16-2005

PMHe
said
"
masterpieces
.
"

That
's
all
I
have
to
add
.

Now
,
where
did
this
come
from
?

This
speech
?

I
mean
it
sounds
like
we
've
only
got
about
the
last
half
of
this
speech
.

It
's
apparent
that
at
some
point
he
must
have
been
discussing
raw
graphical
power
.
"

It
will
more
than
hold
its
own
.
"

That
makes
feel
a
bit
better
about
that
issue
,
but
it
is
Reggie
,
meaning
I
know
it
's
his
job
to
hype
...
He
mentions
competitor
spec
sheets
as
if
he
has
something
comparable
to
them
right
now
(
i.e.
,
as
he
's
talking
to
these
people
)
.

There
's
got
to
be
some
information
on
this
somewhere
.

I
need
some
serious
reassurance
about
the
graphics
,
and
it
sounds
like
this
could
be
the
first
indication
that
the
power
issue
is
about
to
be
put
to
rest
.

I
mean
,
if
all
the
systems
are
within
10
%
or
so
of
each
other
in
terms
of
raw
power
,
then
the
graphics
debate
is
dead
.

Put
the
best
graphical
games
of
all
three
systems
now
,
and
you
can
barely
tell
a
true
difference
.

I
assume
it
's
going
to
be
exactly
the
same
for
the
next
generation
.

Of
course
,
that
's
just
all
my
speculation
.

As
to
the
graphical
power
,
all
I
can
say
is
search
for
the
thread
back
around
e3
time
about
the
new
patent
concerning
cube
mapping
.

Some
said
that
was
old
technology
.

But
read
the
whole
patent
.

It
is
not
the
same
as
the
old
"
cube
maps
.
"

It
is
a
new
technology
that
is
designed
to
allow
for
"
low
"
spec
systems
that
consume
low
power
to
outperform
high
tech
,
expensive
,
loud
energy
wasting
chipsets
.

I
would
n't
be
surprised
if
the
specs
themselves
are
on
par
with
M$
,
and
in
practice
are
up
to
Sony	B	Sony	Sony	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony	000	000
's
system
-
if
this
tech
actually
is
part
of
the
RevOlution	B	RevOlution	Revolution	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution	000	000
...

EDIT
:
I
justlistened
to
this
.

Is
n't
it
the
pre-e3
Nintendo
conference
?

Thatthing
was
an
hour
long
.

That
's
probably
why
you
did
n't
notice
.

about

There
are
already
some
sites
up
to
try

sway

http://www.1080up.org/

You
may
want
to
e-mail
Nintendo
yourself
as
well

The
more
people
that
do
may
sway
them
to
add
it

I
plan
to
call
Nintendo
out
on
it
ON

and
KC	B	KC	Kansas_City_Royals	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals	000	000

hopefully
to
shame

into
it
.

I
'm
a

fan

already
have
a
HD
set
and
will
be
severely
PISSED
if

does

There
was
a
time
when
the
ultimate
source
of
pride
in
this
country
was
being
an
American
Citizen
.

It
was
an
awesome
thing
,
and
we
had
free
mandatory
public
education
so
everyone
could
be
better
citizens
.

We
had
public
meetings
and
parties
so
people
could
be
better
engaged
as
citizens
.

Being
an
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
meant
being
a
CITIZEN
in
bold
italic
capital
letters
.

Nothing
superseded
it
.

But
things
started
changing
around
1980
or
so
with
the
Reagan	B	Reagan Revolution	Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan	000	000
Revolution	I	Reagan Revolution	Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Ronald_Reagan	000	000
as
the
concept
of
citizen
was
discounted
.

This
reached
its
pinnacle
during
the
roll
up
to
the
Iraq	B	Iraq War	Iraq_War	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War	000	000
War	I	Iraq War	Iraq_War	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War	000	000
as
countless
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
citizens
were
demonized
and
attacked
as
traitors
for
not
supporting
a
war
of
choice
against
a
country
that
had
not
attacked
and
could
not
attack
us
.

Something
had
to
take
the
place
of
being
an
American
Citizen
as
the
ultimate
sign
of
patriotism
and
righteousness
.

Some
tried
"
real
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
"
but
that
just
smacked
of
moronic
stupidity
.

Others
tried
,
"
middle
America
"
but
that
left
out
the
majority
of
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
living
on
the
coast
.

What
took
root
was
"
Taxpayers
"
which
came
to
symbolize
everyone
we
were
trying
to
serve
.

Why
do
we
have
to
cut
the
benefits
of
public
workers
?

The
Taxpayers	B	Taxpayers	Tax	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax	000	000
deserve
it
!

Why
do
we
need
to
eliminate
medical
care
for
the
elderly
?

The
Taxpayers	B	Taxpayers	Tax	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax	000	000
deserve
it
!

Why
do
we
need
to
get
Obama	B	Obama	Barack_Obama	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama	000	000
out
of
the
White	B	White House	White_House	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House	000	000
House	I	White House	White_House	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House	000	000
?

The
Taxpayers	B	Taxpayers	Tax	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax	000	000
deserve
it
!

Why
do
we
spend
$
10
million
investigating
Clinton	B	Clinton	Bill_Clinton	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton	000	000
's
use
of
his
privates
?

The
Taxpayers	B	Taxpayers	Tax	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax	000	000
deserve
it
!

Why
should
we
deny
marriage
equality
?

The
Taxpayers	B	Taxpayers	Tax	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax	000	000
deserve
it
!

And
it
goes
for
both
sides
of
the
aisle
.

Seemingly
rational
Democratic	B	Democratic	Democratic_Party_(United_States)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)	000	000
legislators
start
saying
we
need
to
protect
Social	B	Social Security	Social_Security_(United_States)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)	000	000
Security	I	Social Security	Social_Security_(United_States)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)	000	000
because
the
Taxpayers	B	Taxpayers	Tax	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax	000	000
deserve
it
!

End
the
Iraq	B	Iraq War	Iraq_War	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War	000	000
War	I	Iraq War	Iraq_War	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War	000	000
why
?

The
Taxpayers	B	Taxpayers	Tax	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax	000	000
deserve
it
!

Eliminate
bargaining
for
public
sector
unions
?

The
Taxpayers	B	Taxpayers	Tax	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax	000	000
deserve
it
!

(
Yeah
,
I
'm
looking
at
you
Sweeney
.

And
your
well-funded
2013
primary
from
a
union
member
who
understands
how
important
bargaining
is
.
)

But
there
is
a
massive
flaw
that
makes
the
use
of
"
Taxpayers
"
even
more
moronic
than
"
real
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
.
"

At
least
"
real
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
"
implies
there
are
"
unreal
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
"
out
there
to
fight
.

But
anyone
who
buys
a
tire
for
a
car
,
a
gallon
of
gasoline
,
takes
a
paycheck
from
an
honest
employer
,
rides
an
airplane
,
buys
a
house
,
buys
a
book
,
goes
to
the
movies
,
or
engages
in
any
other
of
a
billion
different
actions
and
transactions
is
an
American
Taxpayer
.

In
fact
,
you
do
n't
even
have
to
set
foot
in
the
United	B	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
States	I	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
to
be
a

.

meaning

and
gets
a
hotel

for
the
people
he
pays
to
treat
them
like

is
an
American
Taxpayer
.

And
you
know
who
else
is
an
American
Taxpayer
?

The
school
teacher
Chris	B	Chris Christie	Chris_Christie	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Christie	000	000
Christie	I	Chris Christie	Chris_Christie	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Christie	000	000
demonized
the
other
day
as
screwing
over
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
Taxpayers
.

The
state
union
worker
who
Steve
Sweeney
just
demonized
as
sucking
at
the
teat
of
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
Taxpayers
!

All
of
these
people
who
the
right
and
"
left
"
have
demonized
as
screwing
over
the
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
Taxpayers
are
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
Taxpayers
!

But
I
'll
take
it
one
more
step
,
and
the
saddest
thing
about
what
I
am
about
to
lay
out
for
you
is
that
it
is
not
taking
my
argument
to
the
illogical
extreme
.

It
is
not
reductio
ad
absurdum
.

It
is
simply
a
plain
hard
fact
--
something
sorely
missing
in
our
public
and
political
discourse
today
--
that
the
following
people
were
not
only
American
Taxpayers
but
also
New
Jersey
Taxpayers
:

Abd
al-Aziz
al-UmariAhmed
al-Ghamdi
Salim
al-Hazmi
Nawaf
al-Hazmi
Majid
Muqid
Khalid
al-Mihdhar
Hani
Hanjur

These
seven
men
at
one
time
or
another
paid
New	B	New Jersey	New_Jersey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey	000	000
Jersey	I	New Jersey	New_Jersey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey	000	000
and
United	B	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
States	I	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
sales
and
income
taxes
,
gasoline
taxes
,
excise
taxes
,
property
taxes
,
and
any
number
or
other
fees
or
taxes
.

And
on
September
11th
these
seven
men
boarded
airplanes
and
flew
them
the
fuck
into
the
World	B	World Trade Center	World_Trade_Center	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center	000	000
Trade	I	World Trade Center	World_Trade_Center	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center	000	000
Center	I	World Trade Center	World_Trade_Center	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center	000	000
,
the
Pentagon	B	Pentagon	The_Pentagon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon	000	000
and
thanks
to
some
courageous
passengers
an
empty
field
in
Pennsylvania	B	Pennsylvania	Pennsylvania	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania	000	000
.

So
the
next
time
some
moronic
politician
wants
to
tell
you
that
we
are
doing
something
for
the
taxpayers
,
do
n't
let
them
use
that
rhetoric
to
shut
you
down
.

Just
remind
them
that
everyone
is
a
taxpayer
,
even
those
who
hate
this
country
,
and
you
do
n't
want
to
justify
political
actions
in
a
way
that
supports
the
terrorists
of
9/11
.

We
need
to
go
back
to
talking
about
American
Citizens
,
about
citizenship
,
about
engaging
in
public
life
as
an
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
.

These
are
things
that
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
and
immigrants
can
aspire
to
and
desire
.

It
is
hard
to
be
a
good
citizen
.

It
takes
work
to
be
a
citizen
.

You
have
to
sacrifice
to
be
a
citizen
.

You
have
to
give
up
evenings
with
your
children
to
be
a
citizen
.

You
have
to
waste
vacation
days
at
work
to
be
a
citizen
.

All
you
have
to
do
to
be
a
taxpayer
is
buy

The
dichotomy
of
how
many
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
view
science
was
brought
home
to
me
rather
vividly
the
other
day
in
two
television
shows
on
the
same
evening
.

A
Nova	B	Nova	Nova_(TV_series)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_(TV_series)	000	000
program
on
PBS	B	PBS	PBS	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS	000	000
called
The
Four
Winged
Dinosaur
was
a
fascinating
look
at
how
science
works
.

It
was
a
documentary
about
the
investigation
of
flightless
birds
,
in
particular
the
archaeopteryx
.

That
same
evening
,
on
the
NRB
Network
,
there
was
a
Creation	B	Creation Ministries International	Creation_Ministries_International	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Ministries_International	000	000

IsolationThere
is
a
large
amount
of
intentional
and
incidental
isolation
that
happens
when
you
are
a
JW	B	JW	Jehovah's_Witnesses	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses	000	000
.

The
advice
that
bad
associations
spoil
useful
gifts
is
one
that
is
repeated
continually.Now
,
the
difficult
part
is
that
each
and
every

Witness	I	Jehovah 's Witness	Jehovah's_Witnesses	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses	000	000
is
brought
up
in
a
slightly
different
way
.

There
is
a
certain
amount
of
personal
interpretation
allowed
,
and
there
are
also
cultural
differences
between
different
countries.I
can
only
speak
for
my
own
experience
,
and
those
of
the
people
I
knew
personally
.

I
grew
up
in
a
small
town
in
Australia	B	Australia	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
,
and
in
my
early
years
I
doubt
I
mixed
with
barely
any
non-Jehovah
’s
Witness
children
,
and
when
I
was
at
school
the
time
I
was
not
at
school
I
primarily
spent
time
with
other
Jehovah	B	Jehovah	Jehovah	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah	000	000

Witness
children
.

friends
at
the
time
are
some
of
the
most
amazing
and
genuine
people
I
have
ever
met

What
Is
'
Evil
'
?

Written
by
Lee
Marsh

Sunday
,
26
February
2012
21:28
Over
the
past
week
I
have
talked
to
various
people
about
events
in
my
family
.

The
word
“
evil
”
keeps
getting
thrown
around
to
describe
my
mother
.

I
am
always
surprised
by
it
.

I
do
n’t
generally
think
of
people
in
terms
of
their
actions
being
evil
.

So
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
maybe
my
mother
’s
actions
,
or
inactions
,
were
evil.Generally
when
I
am
faced
with
a
question
I
turn
to
the
books
.

I
do
research
.

So
my
research
this
week
involved
the
nature
of
evil
.

What
it
evil
?

How
would
I
recognize
it
when
and
if
I
saw
it
?

So
my
first
stop
is
to
get
the
definition
of
evil
.

Ridiculous
Beliefs
Jehovah

Witnesses
Take

Written

Many
of
the
things
written
about
the
JW	B	JW	Jehovah's_Witnesses	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses	000	000
religion
are
to
expose
the
flaws
in
the
organization
policy
.

It
does
n’t
take
much
digging
to
uncover
a
large
amount
of
lies
,
hypocrisy
,
ridiculous
former
beliefs
,
sweeping
things
under
the
carpet
,
arrogance
,
and
a
North	B	North Korea	North_Korea	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea	000	000
Korea	I	North Korea	North_Korea	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea	000	000
approach
to
running
the
religion
,
and
playing
some
pretty
serious
hardball
with
anyone
who
does
n’t
play
by
the
rules.Plus
a
corporate
culture
where
you
are
rewarded
for
being
obedient
,
loyal
and
not
shaking
up
the
status
quo
.

Like
a
sales
organization
where
you
are
selling
a
faulty
product
,
initially
members
seem
to
buy
into
the
idea
,
sell
it
passionately
,
but
after
a
while
you
begin
to
see
the
flaws
in
it
,
and
ultimately
realize
that
you
have
a
dud
.

The

Watchtower
,
according
to
sources
I
trust
,
contains
the
following
lines
with
regard
to
what
Jehovah
’s
Witnesses
(
JWs
)
refer
to
as
apostates
,
that
is
,
any
former
Witness
who
now
speaks
openly
questioning
the
Watchtower
Society
(
WTS
)
,
the
Bible
or
the
Witnesses
:
"
Modern
day
apostates
display
characteristics
similar
to
those
of
the
Devil
.

Their
mind
may
be
poisoned
by
a
critical
attitude
towards
individuals
in
the
congregations
,
Christian
elders
or
the
Governing
Body
.

Some
apostates
oppose
the
use
of
the
divine
name
,
Jehovah
.

They
are
not
interested
in
learning
about
Jehovah
,
or
in
serving
him
.

Like
their
father
,
Satan
,
apostates
target
people
of
integrity
.

Is
this
really
Bellingham
?

Did
we
just
see
our
local
"
storm
troopers
"
in
full
riot
gear
evicting
peaceful
protesters
from
the
park
?

The
protesters
who
are
brave
enough
to
put
themselves
on
the
line
in
the
struggle
for
a
more
equitable
democracy
,
live
in
tents
in
the
rain
and
cold
,
educate
us
to
the
facts
of
corporate
thievery
,
be
arrested
?

Occupy	B	Occupy movement	Occupy_movement	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement	000	000
movement	I	Occupy movement	Occupy_movement	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement	000	000
includes
all
voices
for
justice
.

They
are
our
hope
for
our
future
.

Rather
than
protecting
the
grass
in
the
park
,
we
should
protect
non-violent
civil
disobedience
.

The
city
's
response
was
deplorable.Belle

LETTER

Calls
for
protesters
to
repair
park

Occupy
Bellingham	B	Bellingham	Bellingham,_Washington	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington	000	000
protesters
have
made
their
statements
and
we
have
heard
their
complaints
about
our
world
.

They
have
discussed
how
to
solve
the
world
's
economic
and
environmental
problems
.

Now
they
can
do
the
right
thing
and
remain
to
clean
up
the
mess
they
have
made
.

The
city
can
levy
fines
on
those
responsible
for
the
destruction
of
public
property
and
for
encouraging
others
to
do
so
.

It
is
common
practice
for
the
city
to
demand
restitution
in
such
cases
.

Those
who
supported
Bellingham	B	Bellingham	Bellingham,_Washington	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington	000	000
protesters
can
also
donate
to
the
city
to
offset
the
cost
to
the
taxpayers
to
clean
up
the
human
and
material
waste
dumped
in
our
park
.

Those
who
do
not
have
the
means
to
donate
money
can
donate
their
time
and
volunteer
to
clean
other
areas
of
Bellingham	B	Bellingham	Bellingham,_Washington	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington	000	000
littered
with
trash
.

Free
speech
is
a
right
of
every
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
;
dumping
your
garbage
in
public
is
not
.

The
protesters
can
now
claim
a
merit
badge
for
civil
disobedience
.

Play
time
is
over
;
the
Occupy
Protesters
should
also
demonstrate
some
respect
to
the
citizens

Luckily
,

were
able
to
capture
many
incidences

will
these

Parts

gathered
downtown
Friday
afternoon

to
rally
against
economic

stopped
for

at
the

corner
just
as
a
large
group
of

arrived
.

When
the
light
turned
green
,
he
revved
the
engine
and
zipped
down
toward
Railroad

,
leaving
a
streak
of
black

drifting
through
the
crowd

He
circled
the

to

again
at
the

as
the
crowds
passed
on
the

A
policeman
took
a
position
between
the

and
the
crowd
but
one
young
woman
sat
down
directly
in

of
the
truck

As

light
turned
green
,
the
trucker
attempted
to
turn
away
from
the
woman
and
pass
her
but
it
was
too
close
and
other
protesters
began
to
fill
up
the
pavement
.

.

The
aim
of
our
study
was
to
find

the
association
of
MICA	B	MICA	Mica	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mica	000	000
alleles
with
JRA	B	JRA	Japanese_Red_Army	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Red_Army	000	000
patients
(

)
and
healthy
controls

(
n
=
108
)
from
Latvia	B	Latvia	Latvia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia	000	000
.

The
samples
were
analysed
for
MICA	B	MICA	Mica	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mica	000	000
by
PCR	B	PCR	Polymerase_chain_reaction	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction	000	000

HLA-DQ	B	HLA-DQ	HLA-DQ	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLA-DQ	000	000
was

genotyped
by

was
significantly
increased
in
patients

(
40/119
,
34
%
)
compared
to

.

4/5

genotype
was
also
significantly
increased
in
JRA	B	JRA	Japanese_Red_Army	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Red_Army	000	000
patients
(
22/119
,

18

compared
to

.

5/5
.1
genotype
was
decreased
in
JRA	B	JRA	Japanese_Red_Army	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Red_Army	000	000
patients
(
4/119
,
3
%
)
compared
to

12
%
)
controls
(
OR
=
0.25

)
.

In
conclusion
,
allele
A4
of
MICA	B	MICA	Mica	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mica	000	000
is
increased
in

JRA	B	JRA	Japanese_Red_Army	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Red_Army	000	000
patients
compared
to
healthy
controls
and
4/5
.1
genotype
also
increased

in
Latvian	B	Latvian	Latvia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia	000	000
patients
with
JRA	B	JRA	Japanese_Red_Army	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Red_Army	000	000
.

Our
findings
suggest
that
MICA	B	MICA	Mica	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mica	000	000
may
play
an

important
role
in
the
etiopathogenesis
of
IDDM	B	IDDM	Diabetes_mellitus_type_1	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1	000	000

About
Jewogle

Jewogle
is
not
quite
like
any
other
Jewish

the
web

It
looks
like
Google
.

(
The
look
is
,
in
fact
,
a
parody
)
.

But
,
Jewogle
is
NOT
a
search
engine
of
other
Jewish
sites
.

Jewogle
brings
you
both
a
Kosher
Search
engine

allows
you
to
find

The
real
estate
market
in
the
Washington	B	Washington	Washington,_D.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.	000	000
metro
area
has
been
luckier
than
most
in
maintaining
its
stability
,
but
it
has
by
no
means
been
immune
to
the
economic
downturn
.

While
homes
in
some
neighborhoods
have
managed
to
hold
their
value
and
even
experience
price
increases
,
in
others
,
homes
still
languish
on
the
market
.

Sellers
have
a
few
options
available
if
their
home
stays
on
the
market
too
long
,
including
lowering
the
price
,
making
some
home
improvements
or
renting
their
home
while
waiting
for
the
market
to
improve
.

area	I	DC area	Washington_metropolitan_area	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_metropolitan_area	000	000
,
most
homes
should
sell
within
no
more
than
60
days
if
they
are
properly
priced
and
in
good
condition
,
”
said
Valerie
Blake
,
an
associate
broker
with
Prudential
Carruthers
Realtors
in
the
District
.

“
There
are
three
things
that
determine
whether
a
home
sells
and
for
how
much
:
location
,
condition
and
price
.

You
ca
n’t
control
the
location
,
so
you
have
to
look
at
the
condition
and
price
if
something
is
not
selling

Knowing
How
to
Spot
Excellent
Real
Estate
Investment
Opportunities

Posted

To
this
day
,
owning
a
real
estate
investment
is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
attaining
a
profitable
asset
that
makes
sizeable
income
in
a
very
short
time
.

The
Forbes	B	Forbes magazine	Forbes	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes	000	000
magazine	I	Forbes magazine	Forbes	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes	000	000
has
labelled
real
estate
properties
as
one
of
the
best
income
generating
resources
as
well
as
the
best
returns
in
the
last
five
years
.

Because
of
this
,
it
has
become
a
widespread
feature
many
individuals
covet
of
gaining
ownership
.

However
,
how
can
you
find
a
real
estate
investment
?

How
do
you
figure
out
it
is
an
exceptional
asset
opportunity
?

Having
a
keen
eye
and
knowing
where
to
look
are
two
qualities
each
individual
must
have
in
order
to
take
the
first
step
towards
spotting
real
estate
investment
breaks
.

The
following
are
some
useful
tips
that
were
compiled
from
successful
investors
:

1
.
)

Overcome
hurdles
.

Hearsay
’s
are
always
surrounding
us
.

All
with
different
news
that
this
property
will
reap
you
more
rewards
as
compared
to
the
other
and
vice
versa
.

Or
,
you
may
constantly
hear
that
real
estate
investments
will
not
boom
.

In
spite
of
these
sayings
and
the
unknowing
things
the
future
may
hold
,
there
are
countless
of
ways
to
help
you
identify
a
good
real
estate
investment
opportunity
that
will
be
beneficial
to
you
in
the
long
run
.

What
matters
most
is
your
own
decision
while
at
the
same
time
,
taking
into
consideration
the
opinions
of
professionals
behind
real
estate
such
as
real
estate
agents
and
brokers
.

2
.
)

Take
your
time
.

A
real
estate
investment
is
a
lifetime
duty
.

It
is
a
serious
matter
that
you
must
learn
how
to
combine
threading
with
caution
and
taking
chances
.

Do
not
be
pressured
and
buy
the
first
property
you
see
.

Know
the
facts
first
,
decipher
and
then
decide
.

3
.
)

Think
out
of
the
box
.

Rather
more
on
profit
than
loss
.

Most
often
,
individuals
lose
a
great
real
estate
investment
opportunity
because
they
dwell
too
much
on
the
income
loss
first
before
foreseeing
the
returns
it
will
generate
them
.

While
it
is
true
that
one
must
be
wary
of
an
investment
’s
financial
disadvantages
,
focusing
more
on
the
positive
side
will
help
you
come
up
with
more
ideas
.

A
home
that
was
in
a
poor
state
before
and
has
undergone
renovation
has
great
market
and
resale
value
as
opposed
to
a
home
that
is
bought
in
good
condition
.

4
.
)

Choose
a
rich
location
.

By
rich
,
it
not
only
means
that
the
people
around
the
area
must
be
from
the
high
society
class
or
living
in
an
upstate
area
.

It
simply
means
that
,
a
location
wherein
migration
is
abundant
.

A
place
wherein
it
is
situated
at
the
heart
of
the
city
life
or
it
is
convenient
to
office
buildings
,
commercial
establishments
,
schools
,
banks
,
hospitals
,
has
a
low
crime
rate
,
high
rate
of
employment
and
the
like
.

Where
you
want
to
buy
lies
on
your
needs
and
wants
and
what
is
vacant
as
of
now
.

When
choosing
a
real
estate
investment
,
it
is
best
that
you
first
figure
out
what
you
want
.

This
way
,
you
narrow
down
your
search
into
a
shorter
list
.

You
can
also
do
a
one
on
one
survey
on
each
location
that
is
listed
.

Making
inquiries
about
it
becomes
a
lot
manageable
.

5
.
)

Look
out
for
newly
opened
facilities
.

Whenever
a
new
service
is
being
manufactured
and
people
have
been
abuzz
about
it
as
well
as
it
is
well
located
,
the
possibility
of
attaining
a
real
estate
investment
near
this
area
is
very
good
.

Research
areas
not
only
within
your
vicinity
but
as
well
as
outside
it
.

You
never
know
there
is
a
great
opportunity
in
the
country
side
.

Gather
up
on
tools
such
as
the
internet
or
a
real
estate
company
to
help
you
determine
more
excellent
openings
.

6
.
)

Make
a
thorough
inspection
.

A
property
whether
it
be
a
residential
or
commercial
real
estate
must
always
be
examined
first
hand
before
divulging
into
more
transactions
.

A
property
’s
overall
state
,
the
foundation
and
structure
of
the
building
and
electrical
wiring
’s
are
only
some
important
aspects
to
look
out
for
.

Ask
for
permits
and
other
documentations
that
will
prove
that
the
real
estate
is
valid
.

A
great
investor
knows
how
to
spot
opportunities
in
hindsight
,
regardless
if
it
is
developed
or
underdeveloped
.

Arm
yourself
with
the
right
skills
and
always
practice
being
careful
.

Take
chances
.

Be
open
.

In
no
time
,
you
will
reap
off
the
rewards
of
your
well-thought
out
decisions

Naturally
,
you
want
a
place
to
stay
that
exudes
appeal

provides
comfort
.

At
the
same
time
,
owning
a
residential
real
estate
is
also
a
great
investment
to
have
these
days
.

You
can
reap
profits
with
its
home
value
or
just
by
simply
reselling
it
.

Also
,
you
can
obtain
financial
assistance
by
using
your
home
’s
equity
.

There
are
many
uses
a
home
can
bring
.

That
is
why
,
it
is
essential
to
invest
smart
and
avoid
falling
into
the
pitfall
of
home
buying
mistakes
most

to
make
.

Owning
a
home
is
supposedly
to
bring
joy
and
a
sense
of
completion
to
any
individual
.

However
,
there
are
just
those
pesky
home
buying
mistakes
that
seemingly
arise
out
of
nowhere
that
causes
conflicts
in
the
whole
home
buying
process
.

In
order
to
avoid
making
them
,
it
is
advised
that
you
gain
knowledge
about
these
general
errors
.

Here
are
some
tips
.

Start
It
By
Doing
Your
Homework

It
is
your
assignment
to
make
some
research
about
the
whole
home
ownership
process
,
from
the
hiring
of
a
professional
to
locating
the
best
priced
property
to
obtaining
a
housing
loan
for
back-up
.

Learn
up
by
scouting
on
real
estate
books
and
understand
the
issues
well
.

The
internet
is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
instantly
gain
knowledge
about
residential
buying
since
it
has
extensive
websites
and
real
estate
online
libraries
that
can
help
you
grasp
the
basics
.

Online
chat
forums
about
real
estate
are
also
present
.

What
’s
more
great
about
it
is
that
there
are
numerous
real
estate
agents
online
that

answer
your
queries
and
shed

light
to
your
doubts
.

Try
asking
your
friends
,
relatives
and
co-workers
who
are
home
owners
for
some
information
.

Or
,
go
to
your
state
’s
real
estate
firm
and
seek
professional
advice
.

Failure
to
Get
Pre-approved
Mortgage
Loan

When
it
comes
to
buying
a
house
,
most
home
buyers
are
in
need
of
fiscal
assistance
to
support
this
purchase
.

Obtaining
a
home
is
costly
and
it
can
cause
a
huge
burden
in
your
finances
.

Applying
for
a
mortgage
loan
will
help
you
completely
gain
tenure
of
a
property
.

Plus
,
a
loan
like
this
will
serve
as
your
basis
as
to
how
much
you
can
afford
.

This
way
,
your
house
hunting
will
be
categorized
under
your
budget
.

This
gives
sellers
an
idea
that
you
are
totally
serious
of
finding
a
home
.

Ensure
A
Valid
Contract

As
a
home
buyer
,
your
home
contract
must
be
entitled
of
your
protection
.

Meaning
,
they
must
the
three
C
’s
or
contingency
sections
.

First
,
is
the
inspection
contingency
which
gives
the
buyer
the
right
to
terminate
the
contract
once
you
spot
countless
of
damages
in
the
house
.

Second
,
is
the
appraisal
contingency
which
states
that
the
appraisal
of
the
house
must
meet
and
not
surpass
the
property
’s
purchase
cost
.

Lastly
,
is
the
mortgage
financing
contingency
which
defends
the
buyer
if
you
are
not
able
to
qualify
for
a
mortgage
loan
.

Think
Long
Term

It
is
very
likely
that
you
will
live
in
this
house
for
many
years
,
but
it
is
also
possible
that
you
will
move
on
to
another
residence
for
the
coming
years
.

So
,
it
is
best
to
think
on
a
long
term
.

This
is
an
investment
that
must
be
done
with
assurance
.

Consider
possible
circumstances
like
when
your
family
will
grow
or
when
you
plan
to
sell
it
.

See
to
it
that
the
house
you
will
buy
has
an
excellent
resale
value
or
its
market
value
increases
every
year
.

Do
A
Walk-through

This
is
also
one
of
the
most
essential
steps
when
house
buying
.

Most
people
shun
this
idea
away
especially
when
they
already
saw
pictures
of
the
residence
.

But
,
what
you
do
not
know
is
that
sellers
stage
their
home
and
hire
professional
photographers
that
make
their
homes
very
appealing
.

Do
it
personally
and
visit
the
house
.

You
can
even
ask
help
from
a
home
inspection
agency
or
a
real
estate
appraiser
to
aid
you
with
the
property
’s
real
condition
and
value
.

Inspect
every
area
of
the
house
,
spot
any
possible
defects
that
needs
minor
to
major
repairs
.

In
this
way
,
sellers
know
about
it
and
will
even
possibly
give
you
a
discount
on
the
selling
price
since
you
still
have
to
shell
out
money
for
renovations
.

By
being
aware
of
the
potential
errors
that
come
with
buying
a
home
and
knowing
how
to
counteract
them
,
the
road
to
this
whole
process
will
be
as
smooth
as
possible
.

A
Home
Buyer
’s
Guide
to
Avoiding
Contract
Closing
Dilemmas

Posted

In
the
business
of
real
estate
,
there
are
two
things
that
happen
--
either
the
seller
proposes
to
the
buyer
to
purchase
the
house
or
the
buyer
sends
an
offer
to
the
seller
to
buy
the
house
.

After
which
,
the
transaction
commences
and
will
only
be
considered
as
a
closed
deal
once
both
parties
involved
have
finished
the
home
ownership
process
as
well
agreed
to
practice
the
whole
agreement
.

However
,
there
are
times
when
closing
a
contract
will
be
terminated
due
to
unsatisfactory
conditions
.

In
order
to
avoid
dealing
with
this
situation
,
it
is
best
that
home
buyers
get
a
clear
picture
first
of
how
the
whole
process
works
.

There
are
a
few
things
that
must
be
aired
out
when
it
comes
to
closing
a
home
buyer
contract
.

As
the
buyer
,
your
main
goal
is
to
make
sure
that
you
secure
tenure
of
the
property
especially
if
the
house
for
sale
is
your
dream
house
.

It
is
also
your
responsibility
to
be
well-informed
and
courteous
in
terms
of
transacting
with
the
seller
.

For
a
seller
,
you
must
also
maintain
a
fair
deal
.

Meaning
,
what
was
settled
is
final
and
your
home
for
sale
must
be
reserved
to
the
buyer
who
is
almost
near
the
requirements
completion
.

Once
these
are
met
,
the
whole
process
will
be
100
%
effective
.

Ways
to
Avoid
Contract
Closing
Issues

1
.
)

Apply
for
a
mortgage
loan
ahead
of
time
.

Qualifying
for
a
housing
loan
these
days
is
not
easy
as
it
was
before
.

When
you
wish
to
obtain
a
mortgage
loan
to
help
you
(
as
a
buyer
)
finance
the
cost
of
your
soon
to
be
home
,
apply
ahead
of
time
.

Take
note
that
most
sellers
move
on
fast
to
another
prospective
home
buyer
when
you
are
not
able
to
produce
any
financing
on
the
stipulated
deadline
.

Having
ample
time
to
get
your
housing
assistance
will
eliminate
the
chances
of
your
contract
termination
.

2
.
)

Know
the
contract
’s
starting
date
.

Usually
,
the
date
indicated
in
the
contract
is
not
really
the
specified
time
for
the
contract
to
commence
.

It
is
vital
that
you
know
when
the
contract
’s
date
is
effective
;
otherwise
all
you
have
is
a
void
piece
of
paper
.

There
are
given
number
of
days
for
requirements
to
be
done
such
as
loan
application
and
approval
,
home
inspection
and
title
holder
.

3
.
)

Have
all
your
documents
ready
.

Most
often
,
closing
of
contract
is
delayed
or
ceased
because
home
buyers
neglect
to
tend
to
their
legal
papers
.

So
,
before
you
go
into
the
whole
home
purchasing
phase
,
it
is
best
for
you
to
know
if
all
needed
documents
are
present
.

Check
if
they
are
valid
and
information
’s
displayed
are
up
to
date
.

4
.
)

Be
present
during
home
inspection
.

Yes
,
home
inspectors
are
hired
to
spot
possible
defects
and
needed
repairs
easier
for
you
.

But
,
do
keep
in
mind
that
they
are
entirely
different
from
one
another
.

Some
inspectors
are
overly
picky
while
others
do
not
mind
at
all
.

So
in
order
to
avoid
any
arguments
between
you
and
the
seller
,
you
must
be
in
attendance
when
home
inspection
is
being
held
.

5
.
)

Ask
assistance
from
a
real
estate
agent
.

This
will
help
you
make
the
job
easier
since
the
agent
is
in
charge
of
it
and
understands
everything
that
goes
into
the
process
.

6
.
)

Hire
a
real
estate
appraiser
.

Employ
an
appraiser
that
is
familiar
with
the
community
or
someone
who
works
within
the
locality
.

This
way
,
appraisal
of
the
home
’s
value
is
correct
.

This
avoids
almost
half
of
the
obstacles
that
may
cause
contract
closing
problems
.

7
.
)

Let
everyone
sign
the
contract
.

If
the
house
for
sale
is
owned
by
a
family
or
a
couple
,
then
see
to
it
that
you
get
each
individual
to
sign
up
the
contract
in
order
to
avoid
faulty
contracts
or
any
misleading
issues
that
will
cause
problems
.

8
.
)

Make
a
review
.

Days
before
the
closing
of
contract
,
see
to
it
that
you
review
all
the
things
indicated
on
the
paper
.

Also
,
it
will
help
to
let
the
seller
go
over
the
contract
once
again
to
eliminate
any
issues
.

If
there
are
any
adjustments
,
then
both
parties
still
have
time
to
deal
with
it
that
will
still
make
the
transaction
come
into
a
successful
close
.

Closing
contracts
are
not
that
dreadful
as
most
people
perceive
it
to
be
.

As
long
as
you
are
attentive
,
thorough
and
responsible
,
the
whole
home
buying
process
will
just
be
a
walk
in
the
park
.

How

on

,
wrote
a
tongue-in-cheek
post
in
her
blog
last
year
about
how
to
wreck
a
short
sale
.

Now
she
’s
followed
it
up
.

(
By
now
most
if
not
all
of
you
know
that
a
short
sale
is
a
home
sold
for
less
than
what
is
owed
on
the
mortgage
,
if
the
lender
approves
the
deal
.
)

Donovan
writes
:

“
Keep
your
uncooperative
tenant

“
This
one
is
a
biggie
.

If
you
really
want
to
torpedo
your
short
sale
,
make
certain
that
your
tenant
refuses
to
allow
access
to
potential
buyers
or
even
worse
to
your
agent
so
that
s/he
can
take
pictures
of
the
house
.

This
will
make
it
very
hard
to
complete
your
short
sale
successfully
.

“
Why
?

It
’s
hard

your
Realtor
to
sell
your
short
sale
if
it
ca
n’t
be
seen

If
you
do
get
an
offer
,
it
’s
likely
to
be
from
an
investor
who
will
not

give

without
being
able
to

(
A
side
note
:
I
sat
in
the
west
balcony
of
Cannon
Chapel
,
where
I
have
sat
many
times
before
,
but
for
the
first
time
noticed
the
similarities
between
Paul
Rudolph
‘
s
square
design
(
see
right
,
view
from
the
west
balcony
)
and
the
design
of
the

Both
have
wonderful
natural
light
filling
the
worship
spaces
from
above
,
seating
in-the-round
,
long
vertical
elements
,
and
a
great
square
pillar
of
space
in
the
center
.

Wright	B	Wright	Frank_Lloyd_Wright	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright	000	000
’s
Temple	B	Temple	Temple	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple	000	000
is
more
symetrical
,
orderly
,
and
rectilinear
while
Rudolph
’s
Chapel
is
flowing
,
raw
,
and
spiraling
--
both
are
great
and
unique
spaces
.

ThursdayMDiv
students
heard
about
the
new
curriculum
from
Dr.
Gail
O’Day
and
other
faculty
members
.

Worship
was
led
by

A
significant
eruption
in
November-December
followed
almost
six

months
of
unrest
and
minor
eruptive
activity
(
Bulletin
v.
20
,
nos.

5
&
9
)
.

During
a
crater
visit
on
13
November
no
precursors
were

observed
,
and
on
18
November
only
background
seismicity
was

recorded
by
the
CNGN
station
(
500
m
E
of
the
crater
)
.

Early
phase
of
activity
,
19-22
November
.

Local
residents
first

noticed
explosions
about
the
time
of
the
onset
of
30
minutes
of

mildly
increasing
seismicity
detected
by
the
CNGN
station
at
1145

on
19
November
.

Following
a
pause
,
seismicity
continued
to
gain

strength
.

Increasing
activity
was
reported
that
afternoon
by

residents
in
Malpaisillo
(
~
10
km
N
)
.

Observations
on
the
night
of

19-20
November
indicated
mild
Strombolian
activity
,
with
vertically

directed
ejecta
,
that
was
gradually
increasing
in
strength
.

A

Notice
to
Airmen	B	Airmen	Airman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airman	000	000
(
NOTAM
)
was
issued
the
next
day
warning
aviators

of
the
volcanic
activity
.

Eruption
tremor
amplitude
increased
continuously
and
saturated
the

CNGN
station
(
60
dB	B	dB	Defensive_back	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back	000	000
gain
)
at
0200
on
the
21st
.

Tremor
was
detected

on
short-period
seismic
stations
within
a
30
km
radius
(
at
San

Cristobal
and
Momotombo	B	Momotombo	Momotombo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momotombo	000	000
volcanoes
,
and
near
the
city
of
Leon
)
.

Energy
release
increased
continuously
and
tremor
could
be
felt
over

1
km
away
,
when
sitting
down
,
as
a
smooth
rocking
motion
.

At
2000
on
21
November
incandescent
bombs
were
being
thrown
up
to

300-400
m
above
the
1992
crater
rim
.

Ash	B	Ash	Volcanic_ash	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash	000	000
content
was
low
compared

with
the
1992
and
May-August
1995
activity
,
and
bombs
were
often

very
large
(
meters
across
)
,
which
deformed
and
broke
up
in
flight
.

Because
of
near-vertical
trajectories
,
few
bombs
fell
outside
the

crater
.

The
new
cone
being
built
within
the
1992
crater
(
figure
1
)

had
a
steep
(
>
45
degrees
)
basal
scarp
,
2-5
m
high
,
followed
by
a

level
bench
and
then
a
less
steep
slope
(
25
degrees
)
to
its
crater
.

Ejecta	B	Ejecta	Ejecta	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejecta	000	000
pulses
maintained
a
frequency
of
20/minute
,
but
the
size
and

duration
of
each
pulse
varied
.

From
0255
to
0310
on
22
November

ejecta
heights
were
<
150
m
but
ash
content
and
degassing
were
much

higher
,
emitting
dark
clouds
with
each
explosion
.

A
thick
,
white

lower
plume
appeared
to
be
escaping
from
a
new
lava
dome
in
the

1992
crater
,
50
m
W	B	W	Watt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt	000	000
of
the
new
cone
(
figure
1
)
.

By
0500
the

eruption
had
regained
previous
intensity
levels
and
exhibited

near-constant
fire-fountain-like
activity
,
bombs
were
larger
,
and

pulse
frequency
increased
to
22/minute
.

The
eruption
continued
at

this
level
for
over
4
hours
.

The
new
cone
had
almost
reached
the
lip
of
the
1992
crater
by
0700

on
22
November
.

At
that
time
the
lava
dome
emitted
a
small
lava

flow
,
2-5
m
wide
and
50
m
long
,
that
followed
the
edge
of
the
new

cone
towards
the
lowest
part
of
the
1992
crater
(
figure
2
)
.

From

0930
to
1000
a
series
of
explosions
ejected
material
to
the
lower

slopes
of
the
new
cone
.

Sand
to
gravel
size
ash
fell
W	B	W	Watt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt	000	000
of
the
cone
,

but
no
large
ejecta
.

Compared
to
the
1992
ejecta
this
material
is

highly
vesicular
with
millimeter-size
vesicles
;
olivine
,
pyroxene
,

and
plagioclase
are
present
,
and
some
plagioclase
crystals
are
1
cm

long
.

That
evening
the
new
cone
overgrew
the
N	B	N	Nitrogen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen	000	000
rim
of
the
1992

crater
and
material
began
spilling
towards
Cerro
La
Mula
.

From
1900

to
2300
a
tongue
of
lava
spilled
over
the
N	B	N	Nitrogen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen	000	000
rim
of
the
1992
crater
.

The
front
moved
at
<
1
m/hour
,
but
blocks
constantly
tumbled
from

the
front
down
to
the
base
of
the
main
cone
.

Lava	B	Lava	Lava	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava	000	000
flows
beyond
the
crater
,
23
November
.

After
1400
on
23

November
dark
gray
pulses
observed
from
25
km
away
formed
a
plume

that
rose
faster
and
higher
than
on
previous
days
,
attaining

several
kilometers
altitude
.

Observations
were
made
from
the

seismic
station
after
1500
.

During
about
1515-1525
the
plume
became

less
ash-rich
,
ejecta
became
less
frequent
,
and
strong
degassing

pulses
were
heard
.

When
regular
pulses
resumed
,
some
bombs
were

ejected
laterally
onto
the
flanks
of
the
main
cone
.

Periodic
heavy

falls
of
1-3
cm
scoria
were
encountered
by
the
scientists
walking

under
the
plume
1.5
km
from
the
cone
.

Red
glow
was
visible
at
1730

over
Cerro
La
Mula
,
and
there
was
a
smell
of
burning
vegetation
,

suggesting
an
active
lava
flow
.

The
lava
tongue
was
observed
at

1800
between
Cerro
La
Mula
and
Cerro	B	Cerro Negro	Cerro_Negro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Negro	000	000
Negro	I	Cerro Negro	Cerro_Negro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerro_Negro	000	000
(
figure
2
)
.

Later
named

the
La
Mula
flow
,
it
was
~
20
m
wide
and
5
m
thick
,
and
advancing
at

~
2
m/hour
.

At
1830
a
20-m-wide
lava
stream
moved
down
the
N
flank
through
a

small
breach
at
a
rate
of
~
150
m/minute
from
the
crater
rim
to
the

base
of
the
cone
.

A
lava
field
spreading
out
from
the
base
of
the

cone
had
reached
~
1
km
from
the
crater
by
2000
,
advancing
10-30

m/hour
along
two
300-m-wide
fronts
(
figure
2
)
.

To
the
E
of
the
flow

the
volcano
flank
appeared
to
be
bulging
and
was
irregular
with

large
blocks
jutting
out
that
occasionally
fell
downslope
,

revealing
incandescent
lava
.

It
appeared
to
the
scientists
that
a

slow-moving
20-m-thick
blocky
lava
flow
was
moving
to
the
crater

rim
and
collapsing
down
the
flank
;
however
,
the
shape
of
the
flank

also
suggested
outward
bulging
.

The
blocky
lava
extended
at
least

200
m
NE	B	NE	Nebraska	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska	000	000
from
the
base
of
the
cone
.

Continuous
and
voluminous
pulses
at
2000
created
a
fountain
that

sent
bombs
at
least
600
m
above
the
crater
.

Ash	B	Ash	Volcanic_ash	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash	000	000
clouds
accompanied

each
pulse
and
occasional
flames
of
burning
gas
reached
100-200
m

above
the
crater
.

This
activity
had
decreased
by
2045
,
and
by
2115

pulses
of
bombs
appeared
only
every
30
seconds
,
although
continual

noise
suggested
smaller
pulses
.

Of
the
four
GPS
stations
set
up
in
the
vicinity
of
the
cone
,
by
23

November
one
had
been
destroyed
by
lava
and
another
was
too

dangerous
to
approach
.

Measurements
at
the
remaining
stations
were

within
the
error
of
the
equipment
(
2
cm
at
best
)
.

However
,
two

fresh
fault
scarps
radial
to
the
cone
were
observed
on
the
W
side

with
5
cm
of
displacement
.

Tremor
energy
increased
continuously

until
1200
on
23
November
,
after
which
it
maintained
a
constant

level
.

Continuing
activity
,
25-26
November
.

The
eruption
plume
was
again

clearly
visible
on
25
November
from
Managua	B	Managua	Managua	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managua	000	000
as
a
diffuse
gray

column
turning
horizontal
at
~
2,000
m
.

At
0900
distinct
pulses
of

dark
gray
ash
rose
from
the
crater
and
formed
mushroom
shapes

before
drifting
W
and
being
incorporated
into
the
plume
;
ashfall

was
reported
in
Leon
and
Corinto
.

At
times
only
massive
bombs
were

thrown
out
,
while
at
others
strong
explosions
sent
up
dense
ash

clouds
.

Ash	B	Ash	Volcanic_ash	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash	000	000
and
highly
vesicular
scoria
<
5
cm
in
size
fell

continuously
on
the
W	B	W	Watt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt	000	000
base
of
the
cone
.

Pulses
of
ash
and
bombs
had

a
frequency
of
20/minute
,
a
characteristic
periodicity
in
this

eruption
.

Pulses
were
strong
enough
to
maintain
a
constant
fountain

of
bombs
as
high
as
600
m
,
some
of
which
were
large
and
visibly
red

5
km
away
;
explosions
were
audible
at
this
distance
.

At
1100
on
25
November
most
bombs
were
still
ejected
vertically
,

but
a
significant
number
were
exiting
at
low
angles
and
falling
low

on
the
flanks
.

The
new
cone
had
grown
to
~
40
m
across
,
and
its
top

was
~
30-50
m
below
the
1992
crater
summit
.

Bombs
fell
mostly
on
the

cone
and
rolled
down
to
the
base
.

The
small
breach
where
the
23

November
lava
flow
exited
was
partly
covered
by
a
new
blocky
flow
,

which
appeared
to
come
straight
N
from
the
new
cone
,
though
no
exit

vent
was
visible
.

It
may
have
been
produced
by
accumulated
,
still

liquid
ejecta
beginning
to
flow
outwards
,
as
seen
on
22
November
.

The
flow
had
advanced
half
way
down
the
flank
,
covering
another

blocky
flow
.

The
dome
in
the
crater
had
grown
to
~
100
m
wide
and
40

m
high
.

Blocks
were
continually
spalling
off
the
dome
,
which
also

sustained
a
continuous
rain
of
bombs
from
the
new
cone
.

Multiple

small
lava
tongues
originated
from
the
dome
.

The
crater
dome
was

less
pronounced
on
26
November
,
and
was
blocky
rather
than
spiny
.

The
new
cone
had
grown
~
10
m
overnight
.

The
two
flows
moving
N
on
the
23rd
had
reached
~
1-1
.5
km
from
the

volcano
.

The
larger
W
lobe
was
~
400
m
wide
and
3-5
m
thick
at
the

front
with
a
small
lobe
extending
down
the
gully
below
Cerro
La

Mula
,
and
another
extending
E
into
a
depression
in
the
old
N	B	N	Nitrogen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen	000	000
lava

field
.

The
E
lobe
had
extended
into
forest
at
the
E
side
of
the
old

N	B	N	Nitrogen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen	000	000
lava
field
.

Over
a
three-hour
period
the
flows
advanced
~
12
m
.

A

low
ash-covered
area
with
a
small
old
cinder
cone
separated
the

lobes
.

The
sides
of
each
flow
were
slowly
(
~
1
m/hour
)
encroaching

on
this
and
thickening
.

The
thick
lava
lobes
below
the
dome
were

advancing
,
and
many
areas
of
the
dome
were
glowing
.

The
~
30-m-wide

La
Mula
lava
flow
had
advanced
W	B	W	Watt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt	000	000
~
500
m
down
a
small
valley
and
was

moving
at
~
1
m/hour
on
25
November
;
by
0600
on
the
26th
it
had

stopped
.

By
0645
the
other
lava
fronts
had
advanced
20-50
m
since

the
previous
evening
.

The
main
W
lobe
had
spread
E	B	E	E	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E	000	000
and
a
large

block
in
the
middle
of
the
flow
had
moved
~
100
m.

Seismic
tremor
levels
remained
high
through
26
November
.

Tremor
was

continuous
and
distinctly
felt
up
to
1.5
km
from
the
cone
.

Satellite
observations
of
the
ash
plume
.

Visible
satellite
imagery

on
25
November
indicated
a
possible
low-level
ash
cloud
at
1245

(
figure
3
)
.

The
height
of
the
plume
was
estimated
at
4,500
m

altitude
and
was
moving
SW
at
~
30
km/hour
.

Another
small
low-level

plume
was
seen
on
imagery
at
0815
the
next
day
at
an
estimated

2,750
m
altitude
and
moving
WSW	B	WSW	Boxing_the_compass	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_the_compass	000	000
at
~
35
km/hour
.

Explosive
activity

increased
on
1
December
,
when
visible
imagery
at
1230
revealed
a

plume
18
km
wide
extending
~
320
km
W	B	W	Watt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt	000	000
;
it
was
estimated
to
be

between
3,000
and
6,000
m
altitude
.

By
0900
on
2
December
,
the

plume
extended
at
least
640
km
W	B	W	Watt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt	000	000
and
was
below
4,000
m.

End
of
the
eruption
,
early
December
.

Explosive
and
effusive

activity
ended
on
6
December
.

However
,
a
lava
flow
was
still
moving

N
on
8
December
.

Isopach

.

An
estimated
12,000
people
were
affected
by
this

eruption
,
about
6,000
of
whom
had
been
evacuated
from
15
rural

communities
.

Farmland
was
significantly
damaged
by
ashfall
and

flows
during
the
harvesting
season
;
most
of
those
affected
were

farmers
and
their

Hosting

is
a
great
honour

that

a

of
responsibility
to
ensure
that
we
deliver
the
best

a
strong

have
set
the
bar
high

means
our

more
challenging

Malcolm
Jenkins
,
CB
,
Ohio
State

Here
at
CSC
,
we
are
all
familiar
with
Jenkins
.

He
's
been
at
the
top
of
our
draft
boards
for
the
past
couple
years
.

He
's
got
the
size
and
ability
to
succeed
in
the
NFL	B	NFL	National_Football_League	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League	000	000
.

I
do
n't
feel
the
need
to
elaborate
on
that
.

We
like
him
.

We
want
him
.

But
in
case
you
forgot
,
diehardbermysaints
made
a
great
FanPost
enumerating
the
3
reasons
to
pick
Jenkins.Some
may
argue
LB	B	LB	Linebacker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker	000	000
is
the
Patriots	B	Patriots	Patriots_(faction)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriots_(faction)	000	000
most
pressing
need
.

However
,
with
Maualuga	B	Maualuga	Rey_Maualuga	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey_Maualuga	000	000
and
Cushing	B	Cushing	Cushing,_Oklahoma	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing,_Oklahoma	000	000
off
the
board
,
I
do
n't
believe
the
Pats	B	Pats	New_England_Patriots	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots	000	000
should
reach
for
Lauranitis
,
Matthews
,
or
Sintim
at
this
point
.

Each
one
of
them
would
fill
a
nice
need
for
the
Pats	B	Pats	New_England_Patriots	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots	000	000
;
Lauranitis
with
the
leadership
,
Matthews
with
the
pass
rush
,
and
Sintim
with
the
experience
in
the
3-4
.

Despite
this
,
one
of
them
should
still
be
available
when
the
Pats	B	Pats	New_England_Patriots	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots	000	000
pick
again
at
#
34
,
making
Jenkins
a
better
value
for
this
pick
.

Aside
from
that
,
a
nucleus
of
Mayo	B	Mayo	Mayo_GAA	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_GAA	000	000
and
Adalius	B	Adalius Thomas	Adalius_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalius_Thomas	000	000
Thomas	I	Adalius Thomas	Adalius_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adalius_Thomas	000	000
is
still
serviceable
when
surrounded
by
midlevel
talent
.

I
do
n't
really
see
the
Patriots	B	Patriots	Patriots_(faction)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriots_(faction)	000	000
going
any
other
direction
here
.

Their
offense
is
solid
.

The
top
OL	B	OL	American_football_positions	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions	000	000
prospects
are
gone
.

Their
pass
rush
and
defensive
line
could
use
some
work
,
but
I
think
that
need
would
be
better
fulfilled
later
this
draft
.

So
,
this
pick
came
to
the
man
us
Saints	B	Saints	New_Orleans_Saints	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints	000	000
fans
have
longed
for
since
Jason	B	Jason David	Jason_David	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_David	000	000
David	I	Jason David	Jason_David	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_David	000	000
first
stepped
on
the
field
in
black
and
gold
.

It
's
a
damn
shame
I
had
to
give
him
to
the
Patriots	B	Patriots	Patriots_(faction)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriots_(faction)	000	000
.

The
Atlanta	B	Atlanta Falcons	Atlanta_Falcons	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons	000	000
Falcons	I	Atlanta Falcons	Atlanta_Falcons	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons	000	000

really
do
get
him
,
I
am

The
best
hope
for
David
to
make
the

is
for
the
Saints
to
select
players
at
other
positions
in
the

Â
While

of

poles
in

along
the
Eldorado	B	Eldorado	Eldorado,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas	000	000

and

)
corridor
have
prompted
a
great
deal
of
discussion
and
debate
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
issue
has
been
one
with
which
cities
have
struggled
for
some
time
.

As
you
will
see
below
,
Frisco	B	Frisco	Frisco,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisco,_Texas	000	000
,
as
well
as
other
cities
,
have
been
attempting
to
regulate
this
issue
for
some
time
.

However
,
we
all
continue
to
be
hampered
by
the
decisions
of
the
Public	B	Public Utility Commission	Public_utilities_commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utilities_commission	000	000
Utility	I	Public Utility Commission	Public_utilities_commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utilities_commission	000	000
Commission	I	Public Utility Commission	Public_utilities_commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utilities_commission	000	000
and
the
courts
of
the
state
of
Texas	B	Texas	Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas	000	000
.

This
paper
attempts
to
provide
some
historical
perspective
on
this
overall
issue
and
also
highlight
for
you
some
specifics
on
related
cost
projections
.

NOTE
:
Please
note
that
the
only
cost
numbers
contained
in
this
report
that
are
confirmed
at
this
point
is
the
cost
of
burying
the
Coserv
lines
along
Eldorado	B	Eldorado	Eldorado,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas	000	000
.

Other
numbers
are
calculated
based
on
the
data
at
hand
at
the
time
of
completing
this
report
.

However
,
such
additional
cost
projections
are
fairly
conservative
based
on
prevailing
market
data
.

Historical
Perspective
of
the
Undergrounding
Issue
:

The
section
attempts
to
provide
you
with
a
high
level
historical
perspective
of
some
of
the
events
that
have
impacted
decisions
related
to
the
undergrounding
of
utilities
.

The	B	The City	San_Francisco	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco	000	000
City	I	The City	San_Francisco	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco	000	000
of
Frisco	B	Frisco	Frisco,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisco,_Texas	000	000
has
been
attempting
to
regulate
the
undergrounding
of
utilities
for
a
number
of
years
.

There
have
been
provisions
contained
in
the
Subdivision
Regulations
for
a
number
of
years
regarding
this
matter
,
some
of
which
have
had
to
be
removed
due
to
court
cases
related
to
this
issue
.

The	B	The City	San_Francisco	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco	000	000
City	I	The City	San_Francisco	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco	000	000
also
passed
an
Underground
Utility
ordinance
a
couple
of
years
ago
to
deal
with
utility
lines
along
thoroughfares
.

However
,
if
the
city
says
the
developer
must
bury
the
lines
along
thoroughfares
and
the
cost
of
that
burial
has
to
be
paid
by
the
developer
then
the
developer
will
argue
they
are
carrying
a
disproportionate
amount
of
the
cost
and/or
that
the
city
does
not
have
a
valid
governmental
interest
in
having
the
lines
buried.Â
And
if
the
city
says
the
utility
must
bury
the
lines
along
thoroughfares
and
the
cost
of
burial
has
to
be
paid
by
the
utility
then
the
utility
will
argue
that
the
cost
of
burial
would
have
to
be
passed
along
to
the
rate
payer
thus
violating
their
rate
tariff
set
by
the
PUC	B	PUC	Public_utilities_commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utilities_commission	000	000
(
Oncor	B	Oncor	Energy_Future_Holdings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Future_Holdings	000	000
)
or
simply
violates
their
Board	B	Board	Board_of_directors	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors	000	000
adopted
rate
structure
(
Coserv
)
.

In
summary
,
these
recent
court
cases
prevent
the
city
from
being
able
to
require
the
burial
of
lines
unless
the
city
(
the
tax
payer
)
pays
the
costs
.

A
quick
cost
analysis
of
the
impact
the
Eldorado	B	Eldorado	Eldorado,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas	000	000
issue
,
as
well
as
the
overall
issue
,
could
have
is
provided
in
the
next
section
.

Â
Cost
Analysis
:

This
section
provides
a
high
level
review
of
the
estimated
cost
to
address
the
undergrounding
issue
.

It
examines
the
cost
from
a
neutral
perspective
of
who
may
have
to
pay
these
costs
but
then
also
provides
an
analysis
of
how
that
cost
,
if
transferred
to
the
City	B	City	San_Francisco	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco	000	000
might
impact
the
tax
rate
.

Cost
Estimate
Example
â

Â

Edlorado
Parkway
:

Approximately
$
5,500,000
to
bury
Coserv
lines
on
both
sides
of
Eldorado
Parkway
(
estimate
provided
by
Coserv
Electric
,
see
Attachment
#

)

5,500,000
Ã
·
4.6
miles
(
approx.
2.3
mi
.

of
right-of-way
per
side
)
=
~
$
1,195,562
per
mile

(
This
calculation
is
the
estimate
to
bury
the
Eldorado
Coserv
line
only
and
does
NOT
include
the
cost
of
a
private
easement
,
boring
or
burial
cost
of
any
additional
utilities
such
as
cable
.

Also
,
this
assumes
the
cost
for
the
entire
length
of
this
section
of
roadway
thus
any
reduction
in
length
drives
up
the
cost
per
mile
estimate
.
)

Â
Potential
Additional
Costs
:

These
estimates
are
based
on
general
market
knowledge
and
could
be
higher
or
lower
.

However
,
a
very
conservative
approach
was
taken
to
completing
these
estimates

City
--
If
the
City
of
Frisco
were
to
assume
the
cost
of
burying
the
Edlorado
Coserv
line
only
(
$
5,500,000
)
,
there
would
need
to
be
an
adjustment
to
the
tax
rate
to
cover
such
cost
.

Below
is
an
approximation
of
what
that
adjustment
would
need
to
look
like

Underground
Utility
Fees
â
$
“
Why
not
pay
for
this
from
the
fees
that
have
already
been
collected
from
the
Underground
Utility
Fee
Ordinance
?

First
,
we
only
have
a
total
of
$
368,834.00
in
the
account
meaning
there
is
nowhere
near
enough
to
complete
the
project
in
question
--
Eldorado	B	Eldorado	Eldorado,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas	000	000
.

Second
,
the
majority
of
the
funds
we
do
have
are
in
other
“
Utility
Zones
”
defined
in
the
Ordinance
which
means
the
majority
of
the
funds
are
not
eligible
to
be
spent
on
the
Eldorado	B	Eldorado	Eldorado,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas	000	000
project
because
they
were
collected
in
other
“
Zones
.
”

Third	B	Third	Third_(chord)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_(chord)	000	000
,
and
most
importantly
,
these
funds
will
more
than
likely
have
to
be
returned
to
those
who
paid
them
due
to
the
enforcement
issues
with
the
ordinance
outlined
in
the
“
Historical
Perspective
”
section
above
.

Oncor	B	Oncor	Energy_Future_Holdings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Future_Holdings	000	000
has
the
ability
to
enter
into
agreements
with
cities
to
pay
for
undergrounding
facilities
.

These
agreements
,
on
a
project
by
project
basis
,
spread
the
cost
of
the
project
across
all
rate
payers
in
the
city
.

However
,
there
are
a
number
of
issues
with
this
process
that
make
it
a
very
risky
proposition
.

Not
the
least
of
which
is
the
fact
that
an
agreement
can
be
entered
into
by
the
city
to
bury
an
Oncor	B	Oncor	Energy_Future_Holdings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Future_Holdings	000	000
line
only
to
have
Coserv
come
right
down
the
same
easement
with
an
overhead
line
.

This
problem
is
identified
in
item
#
2
below
and
has
already
hit
the
City
of
Allen
.

Also
,
Coserv
which
is
the
provider
along
Eldorado	B	Eldorado	Eldorado,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas	000	000
has
no
such
program
available
.

Problems
that
will
continue
after
funding
determination
has
been
made
(
these
apply
to
all
such
easements

just

related
to
the
Eldorado
Parkway
utility
matter
.

The
above
cost
estimate
from
Coserv
does
NOT
include
burying
other
utilities
currently
on
the
overhead
lines
such
as
cable
and
\
or
telephone
.

No
matter
the
funding
source
,
once
a
line
is
buried
this
action
does
not
prevent
another
utility
provider
from
coming
right
down
the
same
easement
and
putting
up
overhead
lines
where
the
previous
lines
would
just
have
been
buried
.

This
problem
exists
unless
of
course
the	B	the City	San_Francisco	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco	000	000
City	I	the City	San_Francisco	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco	000	000
(
the
tax
payers
)
pays
AGAIN
to
have
the
new
lines
buried
.

By
way
of
example
,
if
the
Coserv
lines
along
Eldorado	B	Eldorado	Eldorado,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas	000	000
are
buried
by
the
City	B	City	San_Francisco	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco	000	000
,
then
if
Coserv
wants
to
upgrade
those
lines
in
the
future
via
overhead
lines
or
if
another
utility
provider
wants
to
go
in
the
same
location
with
overhead
lines
they
would
have
the
right
to
do
so
unless
the
City	B	City	San_Francisco	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco	000	000
paid
to
bury
them
a
second
time
.

If
Eldorado	B	Eldorado	Eldorado,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado,_Texas	000	000
lines
are
buried
at
tax
payer
expense
then
what
is
the
next
line
to
be
buried
,
at
what
cost
and
do
you
continue
to
raises
taxes
to
bury
lines
?

If
it
cost
$
5.5
million
to
bury
only
(
2.3
miles
x
2
=)
4.6
miles
of
line
and
the
city
has
roughly
77
miles
of
thoroughfares
and
if
the
cost
is
similar
to
the
line
on
Eldorado
Parkway
as
outlined
above
that
would
equate
to
approximately
$
92,058,274
for
one
side
of
each
thoroughfare
.

For
both
sides
that
would
be
approximately
$
184,116,548
.

Again
,
none
of
these
numbers
account
for
the
“
additional
costs
”
,
as
outlined
above
,
that
may
come
into
play
.

Neighboring
City
’s
Experiences
:

Allen
-

Stated
that
Allen	B	Allen	Allen,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen,_Texas	000	000
“
recently
paid
to
have
Oncor	B	Oncor	Energy_Future_Holdings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Future_Holdings	000	000
put
in
underground
lines
along
Stacy
Road
only
to
have
CoServ
put
up
overhead
lines
along
the
same
section
of
roadway
.
”

Stated
that
there
really
is
“
no
solution
to
the
problem
due
to
the
above
[
problem
]
and
due
to
when
the
line
needs
to
be
expanded
,
the
city
is
faced
with
the
choice
again
of
paying
or
having
the
line
constructed
overhead
.
”

They
went
on
to
say
that
if
we
find
the
“
silver
bullet
”
to
be
sure
to
let
them
know
.

Plano
â
$
“

“
Our
subdivision
ordinance
limits
the
placement
of
above
ground
utilities
to
major
thoroughfares
(
same
as
Frisco
)
.

Â
SubdivisionsÂ
are
occasionallyÂ
built
along
a
major
thoroughfare
without
power
lines
,
only
to
have
them
installed
later
.
”

Â
“
SometimesÂ
homeowners
complain
,
but
eventually
theyÂ
come
to
understand
that
the
utility
company
has
the
right
.
”

Little
Elm
â
$
“

“
We
are
having
identical
issues
.
”

Co-Serv
has
discussed
a
“
secondary
feed
”
needed
down
to
the
end
of
the
LE
peninsula
and
that
the
only
way
to
get
there
is
a
parallel
line
along
the
south
side
of
Eldorado
Parkway
(
existing
overhead
is
on
the
north
side
)
.

“
CoServ
,
and
for
that
matter
every
other
electric
utility
,
takes
the
position
that
if
you
want
it
under
ground
,
the
city
is
expected
to
pay
100
%
of
the
cost
.
”

Coserv
Questions
and
Response
Concerning
Eldorado
and
Undergrounding
in
General
:

Questions
â
$
“

(
1
)
Would
CoServ
consider
adding
an
additional
charge
to
its
customers
in
Frisco	B	Frisco	Frisco,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisco,_Texas	000	000
to
pay
to
place
its
lines
along
major
thoroughfares
underground
?

(
2
)
If
the
answer
to
1
is
yes
,
what
do
you
need
from
the
city
of
Frisco	B	Frisco	Frisco,_Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisco,_Texas	000	000
to
institute
such
a
charge
?

(
3
)
If
the
answer
to
1
is
yes
,
what
do
you
believe
the
monthly
cost
would
be
per
customer
?

Response
â
$
“

“
CoServ
has
been
approached
by
other
cities
we
serve
and
asked
similar
questions
.

Our
response
thus
far
has
been
“
no
”
,
because
...

*
The
cost
of
underground
construction
is
3
to
5
times
the
cost
of
overhead
construction
and
we
have
experienced
recent
dramatic
increases
in
the
cost
of
labor
and
materials
.

We
’re
seeing
some
underground
construction
costs
in
excess
of
$
1
million
per
mile
.

*
There
are
tremendous
logistical
challenges
with
converting
overhead
to
underground
,
not
the
least
of
which
is
cable
and
communications
attachments
,
adequate
underground
easements
,
scheduling
,
etc.
.

All
of
these
can
be
managed
,
but
not
easily
.

*
At
the
point
we
agree
with
one
municipal
entity
,
we
should
expect
to
do
it
with
all
of
them
.

CoServ
is
willing
to
sit
down
with
you
and/or
your
designated
city
representatives
and
try
to
plan
conversion
of
overhead
to
underground
facilities
.

Because
of
road
widening
,
or
other
road
construction
issues
,
we
are
frequently
confronted
with
this
question
.

We
’d
prefer
to
plan
these
changes
without
imposing
fees/charges
to
our
members
.

The
issue
of
fees/charges
,
as
you
know
,
is
ultimately
a
question
CoServ
’s
elected
board
of
directors
must
address
.

My
understanding
of
their
direction
for
me
is
to
find
ways
to
convert
without
raising
rates
.
”

Summary
:

The
bottom
line
is
that
the
cost
of
burying
utility
line
is
very
high
and
the
available
solutions
are
fraught
with
problems
of
their
own.Â
Additionally
,
the
actions
of
the
PUC	B	PUC	Public_utilities_commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utilities_commission	000	000
and
our
Texas	B	Texas	Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas	000	000
courts
have
further
exacerbated
the
problems
.

On
one
hand
,
cities
are
being
told
they
do
not
have
the
authority
to
regulate
this
infrastructure
forcing
it
to
be
underground
and
on
the
other
hand
even
if
cities
fund
the
undergrounding
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
buried
facilities
will
remain
underground
thus
wasting
taxpayers
’
dollars
.

A
modern
,
user-friendly
,
good
value
and
surprisingly
powerful

PC
Photography
package
.

Photoshop	B	Photoshop	Adobe_Photoshop	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop	000	000
is
so
dominant
that
it
has
almost
come
to
define
its
field

-
but
it
's
certainly
not
the
right
photo
editor
for
every
user
.

To
begin

with
it
's
expensive
and
its
high-end
power
is
overkill
for
the
average

home
user
.

More
importantly
,
for
this
largest
market
of
all
,
Photoshop	B	Photoshop	Adobe_Photoshop	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop	000	000

fails
to
provide
any
functionality
in
the
most
important
area
of
all
-

dedicated
handling
of
digital
camera
images
.

While
Paint	B	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
Shop	I	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
Pro	I	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
(
see

page
)
tries
to
match
Photoshop	B	Photoshop	Adobe_Photoshop	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop	000	000
's
functionality
across
the
board
at
a

budget
price
,
MGI
PhotoSuite
has
instead
chosen
to
try
and
fill
the
gap

by
targeting
the
more
focused
needs
of
the
home
photographer
.

It
's
not
just
PhotoSuite
's
intended
use
that
is
so
different
.

While
Paint	B	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
Shop	I	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
Pro	I	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
slavishly
tries
to
copy
the
traditional
Photoshop	B	Photoshop	Adobe_Photoshop	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop	000	000
-
style
interface
,

PhotoSuite
breaks
new
ground
.

Running
down
the
left-hand
side
of
the
screen

is
the
Activity
panel
which
provides
guided
assistance
to
all
commands

and
tools
,
while
across
the
top
of
the
screen
is
the
navigation
bar
with

buttons
for
accessing
the
program
's
seven
main
modules
-
Get
,
Prepare
,

Compose
,
Organize
,
Share
,
Print
and
Browse
.

In
many
ways
using
the
program

is
like
visiting
a
well-structured
and
well
thought-through
Web
site
.

This
should
n't
be
too
surprising
as
PhotoSuite
is
actually
built
on
an

embedded
version
of
Internet
Explorer
5
.

The
first
of
the
PhotoSuite
modules
is
Get
which
is
used
to
access
your

images
from
your
computer
or
scanner
or
digital
camera
.

The
number
of

cameras
PhotoSuite
4
supports
directly
-
Agfa	B	Agfa	Agfa-Gevaert	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agfa-Gevaert	000	000
,
Epson	B	Epson	Seiko_Epson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiko_Epson	000	000
,
Kodak	B	Kodak	Eastman_Kodak	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastman_Kodak	000	000
and
Olympus	B	Olympus	Olympus_Corporation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_Corporation	000	000

-
has
been
increased
,
but
you
should
be
able
to
access
most
models
through

the
generic
TWAIN	B	TWAIN	TWAIN	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWAIN	000	000
interface
.

One
limitation
,
especially
compared
to
Paint	B	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
Shop	I	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
Pro	I	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
's
excellent
image
browser
,
is
that
the
standard
Open
dialog
can

only
show
one
image
preview
at
a
time
.

MGI
has
thrown
in
a
simple
standalone

Viewer
utility
to
help
you
quickly
identify
files
but
again
this
is
restricted

to
showing
single
images
.

This
is
disappointing
,
but
PhotoSuite
makes
up
for
it
with
its
Organize

module
.

This
lets
you
store
multiple
image
thumbnails
in
named
albums
-

ideal
for
handling
all
your
holiday
or
product
shots
for
example
.

It
takes

a
little
work
to
set
up
compared
to
Paint	B	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
Shop	I	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
Pro	I	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
's
instant
browsing
,

but
it
offers
more
power
.

To
begin
with
you
can
add
keywords
for
searching

and
sorting
.

More
importantly
,
albums
can
be
used
as
the
basis
for
slideshows
,

printing
and
Web
display
.

PhotoSuite
specializes
in
dealing
with
sets
of
images

-
ideal
for
PC
Photography
.

Albums
also
come
into
their
own
in
the
Prepare
module
as
their
images

can
be
displayed
in
the
Library	B	Library	Library	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library	000	000
panel
down
the
right
hand
side
of
the

screen
and
dragged
and
dropped
onto
the
central
image
window
for
editing
.

The
Prepare
module
is
itself
split
into
separate
modules
,
such
as
Rotate

and
Crop
,
TouchUp
and
Paint
and
Draw
,
to
cover
all
editing
tasks
.

The

level
of
power
on
offer
is
n't
quite
up
to
Paint	B	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
Shop	I	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
Pro	I	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
levels
,
but
more

users
will
feel
comfortable
with
PhotoSuite
's
simple
Brightness

,

commands

Pro	I	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
's

histogram
adjustments
and
technical
filters
.

In
terms
of
new
power
the
Prepare
module
sees
four
main
enhancements
.

The
first
is
the
introduction
of
the
Photo
Sprayer
tool
.

This
is
a
pretty

typical
image
hose
used
for
spraying
bitmap
objects
,
such
as
flowers
and

butterflies
,
onto
your
image
.

Again
the
control
on
offer
is
surprisingly

advanced
with
customisable
size
,
spread
and
opacity
and
you
can
also
create

your
own
nozzles
.

The
second
is
a
reworking
of
the
existing
PhotoTapestry

effect
.

This
takes
an
image
and
recreates
it
as
a
series
of
tiles
based

on
the
collection
of
30,000
supplied
thumbnails
.

Now
you
can
add
your

own
image
to
the
tile
set
or
create
a
new
set
from
scratch
-
though
this

is
only
practical
if
you
have
plenty
of
images
and
plenty
of
disk
space
!

Much
the
most
impressive
new
feature
is
the
complete
overhaul
of
PhotoSuite
's

Stitching
capabilities
based
on
PhotoVista
technology
MGI
acquired
from

LivePicture
.

Now
you
can
create
seamless
panoramas
simply
by
dragging

up
to
48
images
onto
the
main
image
window
,
roughly
positioning
them
and

then
selecting
your
camera
lens
type
.

You
can
even
choose
to
create
360-degree

immersive
panoramas
.

Generally
the
process
is
simple
and
the
results
are

impressive
and
you
could
easily
expect
to
pay
more
for
less
powerful
dedicated

stitching
software
.

The
Stitching
feature
is
excellent
for
building
up

panoramas
.

The
fourth
new
editing
advance
is
the
improvement
in
what
PhotoSuite

calls
its
"
cut-out
"
handling
.

Essentially
a
cut-out
is
any
selection
of

the
image
that
you
make
using
the
various
marquee
,
magic
wand
and
edge

finder
tools
and
then
float
above
the
underlying
image
.

Now
cut-outs
can

be
stored
by
quickly
sending
them
to
the
Library	B	Library	Library	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library	000	000
or
by
saving
them
to

file
.

You
can
also
now
change
the
edge
fading
and
the
overall
opacity

of
the
cut-out
to
make
it
seem
a
more
integral
part
of
the
underlying

image
.

This
is
undoubtedly
a
step
forward
but
PhotoSuite
definitely

is
n't
the
right
program
for
producing
advanced
layer-based
compositions
.

Instead
its
cut-outs
are
better
seen
as
object-based
props
and
indeed

PhotoSuite
provides
a
selection
of
props
,
such
as
hats
and
hair
,
for
producing

photo-based
projects
in
its
Compose
module
.

The
obvious
use
is
for
producing

humorous
cards
and
generally
having
a
bit
of
fun
but
,
amongst
its
selection

of
over
1200
templates
,
PhotoSuite
also
includes
some
high-resolution

business
options
for
producing
calendars
,
posters
,
business
cards
and

so
on
.

The
Compose
module
offers
thousands
of
photo-based

projects
.

Once
you
've
finished
preparing
your
photo
or
your
project
,
the
next
step

is
to
let
others
see
it
.

The
traditional
approach
to
this
is
catered
for

with
PhotoSuite
's
Print
module
.

This
offers
a
print
preview
in
which
you

can
size
and
position
your
image
either
automatically
or
interactively
.

Alternatively
using
the
enhanced
Print
Multiple
command
you
can
print

multiple
copies
of
the
same
image
on
the
same
page
-
important
when
photo-quality

paper
is
so
expensive
.

As
well
as
generic
layouts
PhotoSuite
now
provides

layouts
designed
for
Kodak	B	Kodak	Eastman_Kodak	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastman_Kodak	000	000
and
Avery	B	Avery	Avery_Dennison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avery_Dennison	000	000
stock
,
but
there
's
still
no
option

to
create
your
own
layout
or
to
print
different
images
on
the
same
page
.

Alternatively
you
can
cut
out
the
need
for
paper
completely

with
the
Share
module
.

This
lets
you
turn
albums
into
slideshows
complete

with
full
control
over
timings
and
transitions
.

You
can
also
add
sound

and
PhotoSuite
4
now
supports
MP3	B	MP3	MP3	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3	000	000
.

If
the
person
you
want
to
show
your

photos
to
is
n't
actually
present
you
can
use
PhotoSuite
's
e-mail
capability
.

This
lets
you
send
individual
or
multiple
files
and
lets
you
automatically

convert
images
to
JPEG	B	JPEG	JPEG	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG	000	000
with
the
option
of
specifying
a
desired
size
.

You

can
even
choose
to
send
slideshows
complete
with
an
embedded
player
.

Alternatively

for
the
widest
possible
access
you
can
post
your
images
to
GatherRound.com
.

The
Share
module
lets
you
create
advanced
slideshows

which
can
be
sent
as
email
.

Web
access
of
this
sort
is
increasingly
important
and
PhotoSuite
's
Share

module
offers
two
new
dedicated
Web
commands
.

The
first
is
the
Animated	B	Animated GIF	Graphics_Interchange_Format	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format	000	000
GIF	I	Animated GIF	Graphics_Interchange_Format	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format	000	000
command
that
lets
you
create
and
edit
simple
bitmap-based
animations

for
inclusion
on
your
Web
page
.

Like
the
slideshow
feature
this
is
based

on
a
storyline
under
the
main
image
window
where
you
can
drag
frames
and

set
up
transitions
.

This
is
effective
for
slideshow-style
effects
but

useless
for
others
such
as
motion-based
animation
.

Here
you
have
to
edit

individual
frames
and
trying
to
swap
between
Share	B	Share	Share_(finance)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_(finance)	000	000
and
Prepare
modules

soon
becomes
a
major
headache
.

The
second
new
command
lets
you
output
image
albums
or
selected
images

as
Web
pages
.

This
support
is
based
on
the
use
of
pre-designed
templates

that
you
can
customise
to
add
your
own
titles
,
captions
and
dates
.

You

can
also
add
or
delete
any
object
on
the
page
,
which
is
just
as
well
as

the
default
designs
are
pretty
awful
with
horrendous
backgrounds
and
distracting

animated
GIFs
.

Once
you
've
customised
a
template
,
however
,
the
end
results

are
generally
impressive
though
I
would
have
preferred
some
simpler
templates

based
on
a
thumbnail
index
and
full-size
image
pages
rather
than
the
combined

slideshow
pages
.

Web
templates
can
be
customised
-
which
is
just
as

well
.

All
told
PhotoSuite
's
Web
capabilities
are
a
mixed
bag
with
advanced

features
in
some
areas
and
surprising
weaknesses
in
others
.

In
particular

the
omission
of
any
serious
JPEG
and
GIF	B	GIF	Graphics_Interchange_Format	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format	000	000
optimisation
control
is
bizarre

-
why
would
you
want
to
produce
animated
GIFs
but
not
ordinary
optimised

GIFs
?

Hopefully
PhotoSuite
5
will
include
a
dedicated
Save	B	Save	Save_(baseball)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)	000	000
for
Web
dialog

with
in-built
preview
and
advanced
JPEG
and
GIF	B	GIF	Graphics_Interchange_Format	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format	000	000
control
.

In
the
meantime

budget
users
for
whom
Web
imaging
is
important
might
well
want
to
hold

off
to
see
what
the
imminent
release
of
the
Web	B	Web	World_Wide_Web	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web	000	000
-
oriented
PhotoImpact	B	PhotoImpact	Ulead_PhotoImpact	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulead_PhotoImpact	000	000
6

offers
.

PhotoSuite
's
mixed
Web-imaging
capabilities
are
particularly
strange

as
otherwise
the
program
has
completely
embraced
the
Net	B	Net	Net_(economics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(economics)	000	000
.

In
particular

PhotoSuite
's
final
module
,
Browse	B	Browse	Browsing	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browsing	000	000
,
takes
advantage
of
its
underlying
browser-based

architecture
to
let
you
surf
the
Net	B	Net	Net_(economics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(economics)	000	000
from
within
the
application
!

This

lets
you
drag
and
drop
images
directly
from
the
Web
onto
your
library

-
copyright
permitting
.

Via
the
dedicated
PhotoSuite
web
site
you
can

also
access
extra
content
,
new
project
templates
,
additional
filters
,

online
tutorials
and
so
on
-
all
of
which
become
a
seamless
part
of
the

existing
program
.

This
is
impressive
stuff
and
MGI
is
leading
the
way
when
it
comes
to

merging
computer
and
Web
,
application
and
content
.

There
is
a
downside

to
PhotoSuite
's
browser-based
approach
,
however
,
in
that
the
program
can

sometimes
seem
unresponsive
and
really
requires
a
speedy
system
to
feel

comfortable
.

Other
possible
reasons
for
looking
elsewhere
include
the

lack
of
advanced
features
such
as
vector
,
channel
and
layer-based
editing
.

It
's
certainly
true
that
you
get
more
all-round
power
with
a
traditional

application
like
Paint	B	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000
Shop	I	Paint Shop Pro	PaintShop_Pro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaintShop_Pro	000	000

I
am
in

If

look

,
you

will
most
likely
see
that
the
parents
of
killers
either
raised
there

kids
in
a
terrible

or
they
were
hardly
ever
around

How
the

does
a

make
multiple

without
his

noticing
?

His

not
paying
any
attention
to
anything
he
does
,

that
's
how
!!!

Parents
are
here
to
police
their
kids
before
they

are
able
to
police
themselves
.

They
sure
make
sure
that
their
son

or

understands
that
violence
hurts
and
that
what
happens

in
most

n't
real

More

will
occur

Your
unsubstantiated

comments
provide
a
very
good
point
.

However
,
the
substantiation
that
games
do
not
cause
violence
comes

from
doing
some
homework
on
the
following
:

How
many
copies
of
first-person
shooters
have
been
sold
,
starting

with
Wolf3D	B	Wolf3D	Wolfenstein_3D	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D	000	000
and
going
all
the
way
up
to
Starseige
or
whatever
is

the
latest
.

Now
figure
out
how
many
of
the
owners
of
these
copies
went
on
to

shoot
kids
in
their
school
(
or
elsewhere
)
.

I
think
you
'll
find
a
large
discrepancy
if
you
can
even
come
up

with
the
numbers
.

If

is

Maybe

No

The
Doomworld
editorial

Dear
Mailbag
,

I
'm
not
going
to
spend
much
in
time
or
length
at
this
,
because
nobody

ever
reads
the
long
letters
,
and
besides
Frasier	B	Frasier	Frasier	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasier	000	000
comes
on
in
twenty

minutes
.

But
I
've
got
to
say
something
,
to
make
some
opposition
,

because
the
integrity
of
the
gaming
community
is
being
defended

by
a
prominent
editorial
that
would
better
have
served
us
had
it

never
been
written
at
all
.

The
editorial
,
by
Dukrous

of
Doomworld.com
,
was
made
reference
to
by
an
article
on
CNN	B	CNN	CNN	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN	000	000
,
as

reported
on
Blue
's
today
(
the
28th
)
.

Suffice
it
to
say
that
this

editorial
has
not
gone
unnoticed
.

I
was
personally
very
curious

to
see
what
Doomworld	B	Doomworld	Doomworld	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomworld	000	000
had
to
say
about
the
Columbine
shootings
,

since
the
Doom	B	Doom	Doom_(video_game)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)	000	000
community
is
under
very
close
scrutiny
right
now

for
reasons
that
do
n't
need
to
be
reviewed
.

So
I
read
this
editorial

and
was
severely
disappointed
.

Instead
of
an
intelligent
,

mature
,
receptive
response
,
the
author
has
published
a
quasi-intellectual

treatise
that
attempts
to
guild
youthful
conviction
and
self-importance

in
what
was
probably
intended
to
be
an
impressive
display
of
philosophical

rigor
and
noble
uprightness
.

It
fails
.

Debunking
his
reasoning
is

busy
work
,
labor
not
worth
its
me
.

What
disappoints
me
so
greatly

in
this
editorial
are
not
its
oversights
,
gross
generalizations
,

leaps
of
logic
,
and
innumerable
contradictions
,
but
its
outright

ignorance
:
the
absence
of
consideration
in
the
author
's
commanding

tone
,
the
sense
of
smug
triumph
that
he
conveys
with
every
ludicrous

conclusion
.

He
would
be
at
fault
for
this
regardless
of
the
merit

of
his
ideas
.

And
he
is
definitely
to
be
faulted
for
making
the

horror
at
Columbine	B	Columbine	Columbine_High_School_massacre	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre	000	000
into
a
platform
on
which
to
parade
his
intellect

and
character
.
"

Peace
can
not
be
kept

force

It
can
only

achieved
by

understanding

What
is
needed
is
not
increased
regulation
,

vigilance

and

These
are
short-sighted

What

lacking

Shootings
and
"
experts
"
with
no
clue

Blue
/
Loonyboi
,

I
happened
to
turn
on
the
TV
last
night
and
catch
a
part
of
an
interview

last
night
.

I
think
it
was
on
20/20
.

I
only
watched
about
two
minutes

of
it
before
I
turned
off
the
TV
.

They
had
some
military
"
expert
"
talking
about
the
shooting

of
the
kids
as
they
were
coming
out
of
a
bible
study
.

(
Not
the
most

recent
shooting
.
)

He
was
explaining
how
it
was
obvious
that
the

games
the
kid
played
gave
him
the
skills
to
kill
his
classmates
.

This
expert
obviously
looked
for
ways
to
prove
his
points
rather

than
looking
at
the
situation
objectively
.

Otherwise
,
he
would
have

seen
that
his
points
actually
prove
the
game
did
NOT
provide
the
"

skills
"
used
.

His
Point
:
It
was
amazing
that
the
kid
scored
5
out
of
8
shots
.

This
shows
an
incredible
aptitude
above
that
of
experts
that
are

trained
to
shoot
.

For
example
,
in
a
recent
shooting
,
four
trained

policemen
were
in
a
shoot-out
and
only
19
of
43
shots
were
good
.

Although
there
were
multiple
people
in
the
classroom
it
was
a
large

room
.

My
Point
:
Apples
and
Oranges
.

It
's
too
bad
that
most
people
will

take
this
at
face
value
.

Shooting
at
unarmed
people
that
are
not

hiding
under
behind
cover
is
a
completely
different
situation
than

when
someone
is
shooting
back
at
you
.

Shooting
at
one
or
two
people

is
not
the
same
as
shooting
at
40
people
.

I
do
n't
care
how
big
the

room
was
,
the
kids
were
grouped
together
in
a
contained
area
.

And

shooting
at
one
person
still
meant
that
others
were
likely
to
be

hit
if
the
shot
missed
the
intended
target
.

The
expert
may
argue

this
but
then
he
is
probably
the
type
of
fool
that
would
try
to

take
out
an
armed
terrorist
surrounded
by
30
hostages
.

In
the
real

world
the
good
guys
wo
n't
shoot
because
the
chance
of
hitting
someone

other
than
the
person
they
are
aiming
at
is
too
high
.

His
Point
:
He
shot
once
at
each
target
which
is
the
way
the
games

teach
people
to
shoot
.

Shoot
one
target
and
quickly
move
on
to
the

next
.

This
goes
against
what
a
trained
person
would
do
;
trained

people
shoot
until
the
target
goes
down
.

My
Point
:
The
kid
was
not
trained
!

He
did
exactly
what
makes
sense

for
someone
attempting
to
create
as
much
damage
to
as
many
people

as
possible
.

He
did
n't
care
if
he
killed
his
target
or
not
.

People

that
are
trained
are
trained
to
take
out
their
target
who
is
a
danger

to
them
.

These
"
targets
"
were
NOT
a
threat
.

Finally
,
one

of
the
most
common
death
match
rules
is
to
STAY
ON
TARGET	B	TARGET	Target_Corporation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation	000	000
.

Why
?

Because
,
your
targets
are
threats
to
you
.

If
you
divide
your
fire

between
multiple
targets
you
are
likely
to
kill
none
of
them
.

This

in
turn
means
there
is
more
fire
being
directed
at
you
.

Further

more
,
for
all
we
know
,
he
WAS
shooting
at
the
same
target
.

He
could

have
missed
with
ever
shot
and
only
managed
to
hit
the
people
around

his
intended
target
(
s
)
.

His
Point
:
He
shot
at
the
head
because
the
games
award
head
shots
.

My
Point
:
Gee
,
which
game
is
that
?

Some
games
award
more
points

or
more
damage
for
head
shots
but
not
games
like
Doom	B	Doom	Doom_(video_game)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)	000	000
,
Quake	B	Quake	Quake_(natural_phenomenon)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(natural_phenomenon)	000	000
,
Quake	B	Quake II	Quake_II	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_II	000	000
II	I	Quake II	Quake_II	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_II	000	000
,
etc.
.

In
fact
,
it
is
only
the
most
recent
crop
of
games
that

award
points
for
head
shots
.

In
general
,
the
games
actually
teach

the
same
thing
that
a
defense
course
would
teach
,
shoot
at
the
point

where
you
are
most
likely
to
hit
...
center
of
mass
.

Anyway
,
the
point
is
that
this
"
expert
"
is
nothing
of

the
sort
.

He
has
made
poor
arguments
that
,
when
looked
at
logically
,

actually
prove
that
the
games
did
not
train
this
kid
...
He
has
made

assumption
and
taken
them
as
facts
and
then
tried
to
make
the
circumstances

match
those
"
facts
"
.

This
kid
acted
contrary
to
the
best
tactics
for
FPS	B	FPS	First-person_shooter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter	000	000
games
.

This

kid
did
what
makes
sense
for
someone
who
is
looking
to
harm
as
many

people
as
possible
.

As
a
side
note
,
the
government
and
people
with
no
clue
are
once

again
trying
to
use
these
shootings
as
a
way
to
increase
gun
control
.

Why
do
we
need
more
gun
control
when
the
current
laws
are
not
being

enforced
.

After
all
,
it
is
illegal
for
a
minor
(
under
18
)
to
purchase

a
weapon
.

It
is
illegal
for
anyone
under
21
to
purchase
a
handgun
.

It
is
illegal
to
have
guns
on
school
property
(
Believe
the
law
states

something
like
guns
are
not
allowed
within
500
yards
of
a
school
)

Jocks

Geeks
?

Dear

's
News
,

I
know
that
a
lot
of
folks

who
write
in
to
you
are
termed
"
geeks
"
and
they
all
seem

to
express
a
deep
resentment
of
their
more
"
popular
"
peers
.

I
want
to
let
everyone
know
that
there
are
other
shades
of
grey
.

In
high
school
I
was
a
Jock	B	Jock	Jock_(athlete)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jock_(athlete)	000	000
.

However
I
wasnt
the
greatest
one
in

the
world
.

Guess
what
else
I
did
?

Surf
the
Internet
,
play
games

like
Doom	B	Doom	Doom_(video_game)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)	000	000
,
and
yes
,
I
did
well
in
school
.

So
what
we
have
here
is

someone
-
mainly
myself
,
who
was
a
geek
and
a
jock
hybrid
.

I
was

more
popular
than
people
who
were
just
normal
kids
who
didnt
belong

to
clubs
,
yet
I
was
not
as
popular
as
some
of
the
more
exceptional

athletes
and
their
click
.

I
am
aghast
to
see
that
there
are
so
many

people
who
are
on
the
far
ends
of
the
spectrum
.

Is
that
the
reality
?

Or
is
that
the
only
group
who
is
being
allowed
to
have
their
voices

heard
because
of
the
resentment
of
the
"
popular
"
in
the

computer
community
?

Is
there
no
middle
ground
?

Are
any
of
these

opposing
sides
taking
steps
to
understand
each
other
?

I
believe

that
there
needs
to
be
more
effort
between
people
to
understand

each
other
.

It
seems
like
we
have
a
social
"
race
war
"

going
on
,
and
just
like
society
needed/needs
to
come
to
terms
with

ethnic
and
race
differences
,
we
need
to
come
to
terms
with
social

ones
.

I
agree
completely

with
you
,
but
there
's
a
problem
here
...
you
and
I
are
both
out
of

high
school
.

When
I
was
in
high
school
(
shudder
)
I
thought
of
things

in
those
same
strange
terms
...
there
were
"
jocks
"
and
"
geeks
"

and
well
,
then
there
was
me
.

:)

My
point
is
this
:

we
can
talk
rationally
about
this
now
because
it
's
behind
us
.

But

for
kids
who
are
still
in
high
school
,
it
's
a
different
story
entirely
.

And
it
's
not
something
easily
solved
,
either
.

Now

here
's
some
logic
I
agree
with

Teac
has
a
hell
of
a
reputation
,
I
do
n't
know
why
exactly
.

Nothing

special
sets
them
apart
but
maybe
they
are
a
little
bit
better
in

marketing
than
their
peers
.

For
example
Philips	B	Philips	Philips	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips	000	000
invented
so
many

wonderful
all
the
goodies
,
all
best
chips
,

mechanisms
,
etc
and
they
do
n't
have
even
10
%
of
TEAC
reputation
.

Maybe
it
is
the
VRDS
thing
-
every
hifi
rag
devoted
countless
pages

explaining
the
principle
of
very
rigid
disc
clamping
system
-
how
the

pressure
clamping
disc
"
prevents
the
CD
from
vibrations
"
but
in
other

players
nothing
prevents
the
vibrations
and
yet
they
still
manage
to

play
well
.

So
to
me
it
seems
like
TEAC
created
an
antidote
to
a

non
existent
poison
,
and
then
they
sold
the
whole
concept
as
their
key

differenciator
and
they
had
to
invent
the
poison
.

Clever
people
.

Anyway
,
they
took
the
stock
,
middle
of
the
range
SONY
mechanism
KSS151A

(
like
in
Sony
CDP227ESD
player
)

and
added
a
large
puck
on
top
of
it
.

Is
it
good
or
bad
-
I
du
n
no
,
but

it
looks
positively
hitech
.

To
be
able
to
sell
the
story
even
better
-
in
this
VRDS
25
player
(
they

named
the
player
after
the
mechanism
name
-
see
how
important
the

plastic
puck
is
to
their
marketing
?

Sortof
like
calling
a
car

Turbo	B	Turbo	Turbocharger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger	000	000
.
)

they
made
the
face
plate
of
10
mm
solid
aluminium
and

everything

is
oh-so-heavy
.

To
my
big
surprise
-
the
main
PCB	B	PCB	Printed_circuit_board	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board	000	000
is
REALLY
a
very
nice
one
.

Almost

like
in
Copland	B	Copland	Aaron_Copland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Copland	000	000
.

Premium
parts
,
audio
grade
electrolytes
,
very
very

neat
auto-CAD
of
PCB	B	PCB	Printed_circuit_board	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board	000	000
layout
,
fully
differential
balanced
topology
and

OH
MY
GOD
-
the
AD1862
super

duper
chip
.

What
a
rare
DAC
.

A
white
raven
.

To
be
found
only
in
world
's

best
players
,
like
for
example
in
the
best
denon
-
the
2560
.

This
DAC
has
current
output
(
the
better
,
more
kosher
type
)
and
it
can

be
lampized
with
R
conversion
.

I
used
570
Ohms
which
I
had
on
hand
.

I
quickly
cut
the
leg
11
of
the
chip
from
the
PCB
track
(
I
mean
I
cut

the
track
leading
from
leg
11
to
next
parts
-
4
opamps
in
a
row
per

phase
.
)

I
wired
the
now
freely
floating
leg
11
to
lampizator
leg
7
and
then

from
leg
7
to
leg
9
-
a
resistor
of
570
Ohms
.

Surprisingly
this
player
has
balanced
outputs
.

Lampization
is
possible
as
SE	B	SE	Sweden	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden	000	000
(
RCA	B	RCA	RCA_connector	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_connector	000	000
)
and
balanced
XLR	B	XLR	XLR_connector	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLR_connector	000	000
at

the
same
time
.

I
quite
like
plain
and
simple
face
plates
like
this
one
.

The
only
minor

reservation
in
this
player
rating
is
it
's
very
slow
drawer
.

Golden
drawer
in
black
player
.

Hmmmm
...
.

Great
PCB	B	PCB	Printed_circuit_board	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board	000	000
-
neat
,
simple
,
beautiful
-
everything
is
first

.

Hats

off

and
the

upsampler
-
NPC	B	NPC	Non-player_character	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-player_character	000	000
and
the
AD1893
.

The
better
parts
from
Mr.
Andreas
(
we

paid
some
100
Euro
plus
)
are
24/192
compatible
and
the
DAC
is
a

20
bit
one
.

The
clock
is
not
typical
-
18
,
xx
meg
.

The
upgrade
allows

to
squeeze
the
max
from
the
1862
DAC
.

It
took
me
10
minutes
do
de

solder
and
solder
the
upgrade
.

I
suspect
that
1862
is
the
same
as
Burr

.

Something
is

telling
me
...

Four

Mmmmmmm
.

Nice	B	Nice	Nice	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice	000	000

per

.

They

go
like
this
from
bottom
of
the
photo
:
L

,
L

,
R

,
L

.

I
took

the
signal
from
the
inner
pair
.

Please
ignore
the
most
right
yellow
wire
-
my
mistake
(
left
channel

phase
neg
)
.

Top-most
blue
wire
is
the
earth
.

Test
hookup
of
the
lampizator
.

(
traces
are
cut
underneath
the
board
to

free
float
the
leg
11
of
each
DAC
,
so
it
is
not
innocent
kind
of

reversible
test
.
)

After
good
result
from
the
test
,
I
went
for
full
lampization
,
internal

tubes
,
one
per
channel
in
anode
follower
mode
-
four
triodes
creating

balanced
XLR	B	XLR	XLR_connector	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLR_connector	000	000
outputs
and
RCA	B	RCA	RCA_connector	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_connector	000	000
single
ended
too
.

I
started
by
removing
the
main
PCB	B	PCB	Printed_circuit_board	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board	000	000
and
installing
Trichord
4
clock
.

Below
you
see
the
crystal
,
two
caps
and
a
resistor
that
had
to
be

removed
(
18
meg
crystal
,
not
typical
16
meg
.
)

The
new
clock
connects
to
the
legs
1
of
the
74HCU04
chip
(
signal
)
and

leg
7th
-
GND	B	GND	Ground_(electricity)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_(electricity)	000	000
(
see
red
lines
)
.

The
VRDS
level
two
(
middle
)
with
composite
bridge
and
cast
alloy
clamp

flywheel
.

Much
much
better
than
the
ugly
cheap
level
1
CMK4
mechanism

from
TEAC
T1
(
CD7
)

Laser
assembly
and
pickup
is
Sony
KSS151A
on
magnetic
rails
-
again
-

very
decent
laser
.

I
simply
love
that
PCB

As
you
see
-
this
player
has
a
transformer
with
dual
primaries
-
230

and
120
VAC	B	VAC	Alternating_current	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current	000	000
.

Good
for
all
continents
.

The
XLRs
and
RCAs
are
so
good
quality
that
they
do
not
need
to
be

replaced
.

They
can
stay
.

The
power
supply
section
houses
a
nice
,
big
,
potted
and
encapsulated

transformer
.

Very
nice
.

There
is
provision
for
230/120
selection
.

The

raw
supplies
and
rectifiers
are
heavy
duty
,
oversized
,
and
(
whatever

that
means
)
-
FOR
AUDIO	B	AUDIO	Digital_audio	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio	000	000
.

In
my
opinion
that
is
BS
because
a
cap
can
be

either
good
or
bad
,
but
FOR
AUDIO	B	AUDIO	Digital_audio	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio	000	000
means
nothing
.

Just
marketing

buzzword
.

You
see
the
AUDIO
caps
and
my
new
bolt
for
holding
the
transformer
of

lampizator
.

This
is
empty
space
under
the
main
PCB	B	PCB	Printed_circuit_board	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board	000	000
where
all
my
new
power
supplies

and
filters
will
be
located
.

New
transformer
installed
.

I
had
two
secondaries
of
110
VAC	B	VAC	Alternating_current	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current	000	000
so
I
used

them
in
dual
mono
config
.

A
tube
(
two
triodes
)
in
balanced
mode
is
ideally
supplied
from
ons

ingle
source
.

If
positive
signal
causes
one
tube
to
draw
current
MORE
,

the
negative
impulse
causes
the
other
half
to
draw
EQUALLY
LESS
.

Summary
current
demand
is
CONSTANT
and
this
is
very
good
.

This
is
main
AC	B	AC	Alternating_current	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current	000	000
cable
of
TEAC
with
added
parasitic
Lampizator
brown

twisted
pair
that
is
transformer
primary
.

This
way
the
Lampizator
is
connected
AFTER
the
switch
,
after
filter
of

AC	B	AC	Alternating_current	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current	000	000
noise
and
after
fuses
as
well
.

In
the
central
section
of
the
player
where
the
mechanism
is
located
-

there
is
additional
large
power
supply
section
with
4
gigantic
caps
and

some
other
stuff
.

So
the
main
PCB	B	PCB	Printed_circuit_board	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board	000	000
gets
very
good
power
.

Above
you
see
the
SPDIF
digitall
output
section
.

There
is
no

transformer
for
signal
(
good
)
and
there
is
TOSLINK	B	TOSLINK	TOSLINK	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOSLINK	000	000
as
well
to
the
left
.

It
makes
overall
a
nice
transport
,
should
you
EVER
want
a
DAC
better

than
internal
AD1862
.

The
Lampizator
power
supplies
are
getting
glued
and
wired
together
.

On

the
right
-
12
V
DC
,
on
the
left
hand
side
-
two
high
voltage
anode

supplies
(
CRC	B	CRC	Cyclic_redundancy_check	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check	000	000
filters
and
integrated
bridges
.

This
is
the
resistor
kit
that
goes
on
the
socket
.

Two
Cathode
resistors

of
200
Ohms
and
two
grid
resistors
of
240K
.

The
twisted
end
becomes

system
ground
.

Lampizator
circuit
ready
to
go
.

Anode
resistors
are
mounted
away
on

caps

.

This
makes
the
triode
socket
less
congested
.

Above
:
all
power
supplies
are
glued
to
the
floor
under
the
main
PCB
.

the
long
black
thing
is
the
power
switch
extension
rod
.

Dark
red
resistors
connected
to
red
wires
are
anode
resistors
in
anode

follower
setup
.

The
tubes
were
mounted
above
main
PCB	B	PCB	Printed_circuit_board	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board	000	000
after
I
removed
the
analog
output

stage
-
8
op-amps
and
their
capacitors
.

There
was
enough
space
for
2

tubes
.

Red
wires
go
to
anodes
of
triodes
.

All
grounds
are
connected
together

in
star
fashion
:

and
RCA	B	RCA	RCA_connector	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_connector	000	000

were
floated
from

SOUND
of
TEAC
VRDS-25

The
sound
is

right
there
with
the
top
players
.

League
zero
-
which
stands
for
no

compromise
,
best
CD
playback
under
the
sun
.

It
is
not
a
winner
,
but

definitely
in
the
same
league
as
the
best
ones
I
tried
.

The
sound
is
overall
the
safest
all
rounder
.

Not
as
goose
bump
magical

midrange
timbre
as
the
TDA1541
players
,
not
as
thunderous
superbass
as

Wolfson	B	Wolfson	Wolfson_Microelectronics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfson_Microelectronics	000	000
,
not
as
crystal
clear
trebles
as
Lampucera
DAC
CS4397
,
and
not

as
deep
deep
hallucination
as
from
BB-1794
of
the
Shanling
CD300
.

But

it
has
no
flaws
or

faults
.

Very
highly
recommended
.

The
tube
:
Russian
6H2P
(
6N2P
)
with
SRPP
and
200
Ohms
in
both
cathodes
.

ECC88	B	ECC88	6DJ8	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6DJ8	000	000
and
E88CC
works
great
as
well
.

2
days
later
:
a
very
enlightening
listening
session
with
a
comparison

between
Audionote
DAC
2
signature
(
2
x
PCM63
)
driven
by
TEAC
as
a

transport
versus

TEAC
lampized
.

As
good
as
the
Audio-Note
DAC2
is
,
the
Teac

VRDS-25
walks
over
it
.

The

amount
of
hidden
information
that
TEAC
pulls
from
very
familiar

recordings
is
just
unbelievable
.

At
the
same
time
it
is
more
powerful
,

more
spacious
,
and
with
stronger
bass
,
which
is
is
controlled
and

powerful
.

My
admiration
for
the
application
of
the
AD-1862
grows
.

I

like
equally
well
the
DENON
DCD2560

The
Teac
is
better
built
,
but

me
and
was
not
slow
to
tell
me
why.I
met
her
last
Friday
morning
at
the
annual
conference
of
members
of
ISME
,
at
which
she
was
speaking
and

I
was
chairing
.

She
said
she
had
cried
the
previous
Wednesday

while
watching
me
on
the
Vincent
Browne
Show
on
TV3	B	TV3	TV3_(Ireland)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV3_(Ireland)	000	000
outline
the
flaws
in
the
performance
of
her
nephew
,
the
late
Brian	B	Brian Lenihan	Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	000	000
Lenihan	I	Brian Lenihan	Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	000	000
,
during
his
time
as
finance
minister
and
as
outlined
in
my
new
book
How
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
Really
Went
Bust
.

She
accused
me
of
attacking
a
man
who
is
not
alive
to
defend
himself
.

I
disagreed
politely
,
mindful
of
the
fact
that
the
woman
must
still
be
grieving
.

I
pointed
out
that
he
’d
had
plenty
of
opportunities
to
discuss
and
defend
his
performance
with
me
when
he
was
alive
.

She
countered
that
I
had
n’t
been
"
in
the
room
"
on
the
infamous
night
that
the
ruinous
bank
guaranteed
was
introduced
.

I
did
n’t
point
out
to
her
that
she
had
n’t
been
there
either
.

But
I
did
say

there
has
been
a
deliberate
and
concerted
effort
by
those
who
were
present
to
limit
what
has
been
revealed
,
allowing
only
a
small
amount
of
documents
to
be
released
under
the
Freedom	B	Freedom of Information Act	Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country	000	000
of	I	Freedom of Information Act	Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country	000	000
Information	I	Freedom of Information Act	Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country	000	000
Act	I	Freedom of Information Act	Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country	000	000
.

I
also
asked
her
to
read
the
book
,
which
I
said
I
believed
was
fair
in
its
portrayal
and
assessment
of
how
Lenihan	B	Lenihan	Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	000	000
and
his
taoiseach
,
Brian	B	Brian Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
Cowen	I	Brian Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
,
had
performed
on
that
night
and
subsequently
.

She
said
she
had
read
it
but
said
no
more
about
that
,
other
than
to
say
that
at
least
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
is
alive
to
defend
himself
.

As
it
happens
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
has
been
unavailable
to
do
so
and
is
unwilling
,
as
his
predecessor
Bertie	B	Bertie Ahern	Bertie_Ahern	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertie_Ahern	000	000
Ahern	I	Bertie Ahern	Bertie_Ahern	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertie_Ahern	000	000
has
been
,
to
defend
his
record
in
public
.

It
all
seems
too
raw
for
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
;
he
may
still
be
in
shock
,
much
as
he
appears
to
have
been
when
he
was
in
office
and
as
everything
came
tumbling
down
around
him
.

O'Rourke	B	O'Rourke	Mary_O'Rourke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_O'Rourke	000	000
is
one
of
his
fiercest
critics
.

She
was
blunt
about
his
shortcomings
and
failings
in
the
recent
two-part
RTÉ
documentary
Crisis
:
Inside
the
Cowen
Government
(
to
which
I
contributed
)
.

It
seems
likely
that
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
would
have
been
greatly
irritated
by
her
and

many
others
(
particularly
Mary	B	Mary Hanafin	Mary_Hanafin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Hanafin	000	000
Hanafin	I	Mary Hanafin	Mary_Hanafin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Hanafin	000	000
)
because
of
their
contributions
to
that
programme
.

Self-serving
would
be
one
way
of
describing
them
.

O’Rourke
’s
criticisms
and
viewing
of
the

programme
made
me
consider
again
whether

I
had
been
fair
to
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
and
Lenihan	B	Lenihan	Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	000	000
in
both
my
book
and
in
my
contributions
to
the
documentary
.

In
the
latter
I
was
dependent
on
the
editing
process
of
others
,
but
the
book
,
while
involving
the
editing
by
others
,
remains
very
much
my
own
responsibility
.

I
stand
by
what
I
said
in
the
documentary
about
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
because
it
sums
up
much
of
what
is
in
the
book
:
it
is
an
appalling
legacy
to
have
been
the
taoiseach
who
oversaw
the
rushed
introduction
of
the
bank
guarantee
and
to
have
surrendered
economic
sovereignty
,
as
happened
last
November
.

His
performance
prior
to
becoming
taoiseach
,
during
his
time
as
finance
minister
,
was
appalling
too
.

This
is
not
hindsight
:
I
wrote
in
April
2008
,
on
his
becoming
leader
of
Fianna
Fáil
,
that
he
had
an
enormous
amount
to
do
to
justify
the
garlands

being
thrown
his
way
and
that
his
performance
as
finance
minister
had
not
been
impressive
.

I
go
into
greater
detail
in
the
book
,
particularly
about
what
others
have
told
me
about
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
’s
behaviour
while
in
office
.

The
obvious
manifestation
of
the
psychological
pressure
he
suffered
was
his
drinking
of
alcohol
.

There
is
little
doubt
but
that
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
did
not
exhibit
sufficient
care
about
his
drinking
while
in
office
.

It
may
have
been
his
way
of
releasing

pressure
,
but
a
middle-aged
man
with
his
responsibilities
,
excessive
weight
and
previous
health
concerns
(
and
the
knowledge
of
the
death
of
his
father
at
the
age
of
51
)
should
not
have
behaved
as
he
did
during
a
national
crisis
.

He
needed
all

his
wits
about
him
at
all
times
,
not
to
be
dealing
with
hangovers
.

But
what
about
Lenihan	B	Lenihan	Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	000	000
’s
performance
?

Lenihan	B	Lenihan	Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	000	000
should
not
and
can
not
be
off-limits
to
legitimate
examination
of
his
record
,
but
there
is
a
danger
that
sympathy
for
his
personal
tragedy
can
lead
to
overly
sympathetic
examination
of
his
record
.

His
illness
,
once
disclosed
,
could
not
be
a
private
matter
,
not
when
he
held
a
key
position
at
one
of
the
most
important
times
in
the
history
of
the
state
.

The
reality
is
that
there
were
very
serious
concerns
in
both
the
Department	B	Department of the Taoiseach	Department_of_the_Taoiseach	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Taoiseach	000	000
of	I	Department of the Taoiseach	Department_of_the_Taoiseach	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Taoiseach	000	000
the	I	Department of the Taoiseach	Department_of_the_Taoiseach	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Taoiseach	000	000
Taoiseach	I	Department of the Taoiseach	Department_of_the_Taoiseach	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Taoiseach	000	000
and
the
Department	B	Department of Finance	Department_of_Finance_(Ireland)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance_(Ireland)	000	000
of	I	Department of Finance	Department_of_Finance_(Ireland)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance_(Ireland)	000	000
Finance	I	Department of Finance	Department_of_Finance_(Ireland)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance_(Ireland)	000	000
in
the
early
months
of
2010
.

Lenihan	B	Lenihan	Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	000	000
was
unavailable
because
of
treatment
on
many
days
when
he
was
needed
.

Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
never
moved
against
him
,
partly
because
of
loyalty

(
and
they
remained
loyal
to
each
other
until
near
the
end
of
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
’s
leadership
)
,
partly
because
of
a
worry
that
the
public
might
react
negatively
to
the
removal
of
a
sick
man
as
if
it
was
callous
rather
than
necessary
,
and

partly
because
of
the
realisation

Lenihan	B	Lenihan	Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	000	000
had
the
communication
skills
that
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
himself
lacked
.

Lenihan	B	Lenihan	Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	000	000
got
a
pass
in
some
respects
because
he
was

likeable
and
engaging
.

Journalists
liked
him
because
he
would
answer
questions
and
be
available
to
do
so
,
unlike
others
.

(
You
could
argue
that
he
played
the
media
along
,
knowing
that
he
would
get
it
somewhat
easier
if
he
engaged
with
it
.
)

Also
he
was
not
part
of
the
government
as
a
full
minister
until
after
the
2007
general
election
and
did
not
get
his
first
economic
ministry
until
after
Ahern	B	Ahern	Bertie_Ahern	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertie_Ahern	000	000
’s
2008
departure
.

He
was
a
lawyer

who
had
to
get
up
to
speed
quickly
on
economic
and
financial
ministries
,

but
he
can
not
evade
responsibility
for
the
guarantee
,
the
establishment
of
the
disastrous
NAMA	B	NAMA	Nama_people	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nama_people	000	000
(
to
which
he
was
central
)
,
the
failed
and
recurring
recapitalisations
of
the
banks
and
the
ultimate
surrender
to
the
EU	B	EU	European_Union	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union	000	000
and
IMF	B	IMF	International_Monetary_Fund	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund	000	000
.

And
much
of
what
he
said
about
the
economy
"
turning
the
corner
"
was
nonsense
.

He
was
unlucky
in
many
respects
--
not
just
with
his
health
but
with
the
impact
of
outside
events
.

I
remember
him
getting
furious
with
me
in
early
November
last
year
as
I
pressed
him
on
soaring
yields
on
Irish	B	Irish	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
bonds
,
suggesting

this
was
the
markets
reacting
to
his
policy
of
increased
austerity
,
knowing

it
would
not
work
.

He
blamed
,
and
with
some
merit
too
,
the
uncertainty
caused
by
comments
made
by
Angela	B	Angela Merkel	Angela_Merkel	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel	000	000
Merkel	I	Angela Merkel	Angela_Merkel	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel	000	000
and
Nicolas	B	Nicolas Sarkozy	Nicolas_Sarkozy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Sarkozy	000	000
Sarkozy	I	Nicolas Sarkozy	Nicolas_Sarkozy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Sarkozy	000	000
that
raised
the
possibility
that
sovereign
states
would
be
allowed
to
default
on
debts
from
2013
,
making
it
almost
impossible
for
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
to
raise
new
loans
on
international
markets
.

Lenihan	B	Lenihan	Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	000	000
and
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
found
that
their
reward
for
doing
all
of
that
had
been
asked
of
them
by
the
European	B	European Commission	European_Commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission	000	000
Commission	I	European Commission	European_Commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission	000	000
and
ECB	B	ECB	European_Central_Bank	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank	000	000
was
to
be
hung
out
last
November
when
it
was
decided
that
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
should
be
sacrificed
for
the
greater
good
of
the
euro
area
.

Knowing
that
it
would
finish
them
politically
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
and
Lenihan	B	Lenihan	Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	000	000
found
the
takeover
but
ultimately
had
to
surrender
.

To
a
degree
it
is
possible
to
feel
sorry
for
them
,
and
the
knowledge
of
his
failure
was
difficult
for
Lenihan	B	Lenihan	Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lenihan,_Jnr	000	000
in
his
final
months
.

The
RTÉ
programme
on
Cowen	B	Cowen	Brian_Cowen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cowen	000	000
’s
crisis
was
great
drama
,
and
had
fantastic
photos
and
footage
upon
which
to
draw
,
and
,
within
the
time
constraints
,
was
fair
.

I
would
argue
that
the
story
is
bigger
than
can
be
told
in
two
hours
of
television
,
and
of
course
I
would
.

But
I
believe
that
,
by
and
large
,
any
unfairness
is
coming
from
the
former
political
colleagues
of
those
under
the
microscope
.

Keith	B	Keith Law	Keith_Law	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Law	000	000
Law	I	Keith Law	Keith_Law	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Law	000	000
he
lost
some
credibility
with
his
list
of
top
50
players
under
25
.

With
Hanson
at
number
40
&
Craig
K
being
number
49
.

He
does
say
Hanson
would
be
in
his
top
dozen
if
healthy
but
dropping
him
that
low
is
BS
considering
he
has
numerous
guys
ahead
of
Hanson
who
have
missed
time
b/c
of
major
surgeries
.

.

Also
having
Brandon	B	Brandon Belt	Brandon_Belt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Belt	000	000
Belt	I	Brandon Belt	Brandon_Belt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Belt	000	000
six
spots
higher
than
Freeman
is
a
joke
.

I
think
he
was
correct
with
Upton
being
number
1
but
I
would
of
had
Kershaw
a
lot
higher
.

I
also
would
not
have
had
Minor	B	Minor	Minor_(law)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)	000	000
on
the
list
.

Braves
on
his
list
:

12
-
Heyward

23
-
Freeman

40
-
Hanson

46
-
Beachy

49
-
Kimbrel

50
-
Minor

PMHe
said
the
only
reason
Kershaw
was
n't
higher
was
the
inherent
risk
of
being
a
starting
pitcher
.

Hitters
are
simply
safer
.

PMSo
,
wait
...
a
very
good
writer
that
understands
how
to
evaluate
baseball
talent
came
out
with
a
list
of
top
talent
under
25
years
old
and
we
have
6
players
on
the
list
and
people
are
complaining
?

PMSo
,
wait
...
a
very
good
writer
that
understands
how
to
evaluate
baseball
talent
came
out
with
a
list
of
top
talent
under
25
years
old
and
we
have
6
players
on
the
list
and
people
are
complaining
?

This
is
n't
Mark
Bowman
or
David
O'Brien
,
this
is
a
guy
that
understands
baseball
.

I
was
n't
trying
to
complain
about
the
number
of
Braves	B	Braves	Atlanta_Braves	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves	000	000
on
the
list
just
trying
to
talk
about
the
list
overall
,
sorry
I
did
n't
make
that
clear
.

I
agree
Law	B	Law	Keith_Law	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Law	000	000
is
a
very
good
analyst
/
writer
who
knows
much
more
about
the
game
than
DOB
or
MB	B	MB	Megabyte	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megabyte	000	000
.

We
can
all
agree
it
is
a
good
sign
for
now
and
the
future
that
our
club
has
this
much
young
talent
.

In
Other
News
...
Apple
Introduces
the
iTaco
.

It
’s
the
most
amazing
thing
I
’ve
ever
experienced
.

In
my
opinion
,
there
are
simply
not
enough
superlatives
in
the
English	B	English	England	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England	000	000
language
to
adequately
praise
this
handheld
miracle
.

Although
there
is
one
word
sufficient
to
describe
its
attainability
:
difficult
.

Ever
since
I
first
heard
about
it
,
I
’ve
been
driving
around
LA	B	LA	Louisiana	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana	000	000
trying
to
figure
out
what
location
would
be
the
best
place
to
get
one
.

I
did
n’t
want
to
camp
out
for
one
like
some
kind
of
Star	B	Star Wars	Star_Wars	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars	000	000
Wars	I	Star Wars	Star_Wars	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars	000	000
fanboy
.

I
definitely
did
n’t
want
to
get
myself
into
an
online
bidding
war
over
one
.

After
a
little
bit
of
pounding
the
keyboard
,
I
’d
find
my
source
.

It
was
a
trek
but
all
holy
grails
involve
traveling
and
some
suffering
.

At
least
I
had
steel-belted
radials
and
air-conditioning
,
those
Hobbits	B	Hobbits	Hobbit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit	000	000
only
had
their
hairy
feet
.

While
many
people
I
know
will
be
gnashing
teeth
and
biting
fingernails
in
high
anxiety
waiting
for
their
chance
at
scoring
the
Swiss
Army
knife
of
cell
phones
,
the
Apple	B	Apple iPhone	IPhone	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone	000	000
iPhone	I	Apple iPhone	IPhone	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone	000	000
,
I
,
on
the
blissful
other
hand
,
will
be
lounging
on
a
warm
,
breezy
Santa	B	Santa Barbara	Santa_Barbara,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California	000	000
Barbara	I	Santa Barbara	Santa_Barbara,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California	000	000
beach
,
sipping
a
margarita
on
the
rocks
(
no
salt
)
and
eating
an
equally
hard
to
get
item
(
at
least
it
is
in
the
authentic
taco
world
)
.

What
am
I
waggishly
referring
to
?

The
eye
taco
,
of
course
,
or
taco
de
ojo
.

Lilly	B	Lilly	In-N-Out_Burger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-N-Out_Burger	000	000
’s
Taqueria
,
near
Santa	B	Santa Barbara	Santa_Barbara,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California	000	000
Barbara	I	Santa Barbara	Santa_Barbara,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California	000	000
’s
rustic
yet
fashionable
downtown
,
will
be
my
version
of
an
Apple	B	Apple Store	Apple_Store	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store	000	000
Store	I	Apple Store	Apple_Store	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store	000	000
come
iPhone	B	iPhone	IPhone	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone	000	000
release
day
.

My
reason
for
driving
almost
80
miles
to
Santa	B	Santa Barbara	Santa_Barbara,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California	000	000
Barbara	I	Santa Barbara	Santa_Barbara,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California	000	000
for
a
taco
is
simple
--
nobody
else
does
eyeball
taco
in
LA	B	LA	Louisiana	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana	000	000
.

The
only
other
city
I
know
of
that
hawks
this
snack
that
eyes
you
back
is
Chicago	B	Chicago	Chicago	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago	000	000
.

At
Chi-Town	B	Chi-Town	Chicago	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago	000	000
’s
Maxwell
Street
Sunday
market
,
there
resides
a
vendor
who
sells
goat
eyeball
tacos
,
Sundays
only
.

What
a
lonely
taco
vendor
he
must
be
.

As
much
as
I
’d
love
to
spend
a
weekend
in
Chicago	B	Chicago	Chicago	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago	000	000
,
I
simply
ca
n’t
make
that
trip
,
so
it
’s
off
to
Santa	B	Santa Barbara	Santa_Barbara,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California	000	000
Barbara	I	Santa Barbara	Santa_Barbara,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California	000	000
.

Lilly	B	Lilly	In-N-Out_Burger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-N-Out_Burger	000	000
’s
tacos
are
cooked
al
vapor
or
steamed
.

When
it
comes
to
meats
,
they
specialize
in
the
bits
I
get
all
tingly
over
like
the
entire
cow
’s
head
.

The
cooks
steam
the
whole
head
of
a
cow
and
then
,
after
it
’s
done
,
remove
various
portions
from
it
,
like
--
the
cabeza
(
head
meat
)
,
lengua
(
tongue
)
and
ojo
(
eye
)
.

After
a
part
is
removed
,
it
is
then
sautéed
on
a
flat
grill
and
tossed
with
spices
and
finally
nestled
into
an
aromatic
steamed
corn
tortilla.Unlike
many
of
LA	B	LA	Louisiana	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana	000	000
’s
taquerias
,
Lilly	B	Lilly	In-N-Out_Burger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-N-Out_Burger	000	000
’s
only
makes
and
moves
tacos
and
sells
nothing
else
.

No
burritos
.

No
enchiladas
.

Just
tacos
and
assorted
beverages
.

Lilly	B	Lilly	In-N-Out_Burger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-N-Out_Burger	000	000
’s
is
the
In-N-Out	B	In-N-Out Burger	In-N-Out_Burger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-N-Out_Burger	000	000
Burger	I	In-N-Out Burger	In-N-Out_Burger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-N-Out_Burger	000	000
of
taquerias
.

Plus
,
they
focus
on
tacos
al
vapor
.

This
tiny
eatery
is
deliciously
specialized
and
the
flavor
of
its
tacos
is
the
proof.I
know
what
you
’re
thinking
.

“
Eyeball	B	Eyeball	Eye	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye	000	000
taco
?

That
’s
a
huge
burden
of
proof
,
”
you
ponder
while
holding
back
the
puke
in
your
mouth
so
it
does
n’t
project
all
over
your
brand
new
iPhone	B	iPhone	IPhone	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone	000	000
.

I
understand
,
but
what
you
need
to
do
first
is
let
go
of
that
instamatic
visual
of
a
bloodshot
orb
the
size
of
a
racquetball
from
your
mind
.

The
ojo
(
eye
)
taco
does
n’t
resemble
a
cow
’s
eye
in
the
least
.

(
Believe
me
,
I
was
hoping
for
a
bloodshot
orb
peering
back
at
me
as
I
ate
.
)

Other
than
what
I
can
guess
were
the
“
whites
”
of
the
cow
’s
eyes
,
those
grayish-white
chunks
I
saw
in
my
ojo
taco
could
be
easily
mistaken
for
plain
fat
.

This
sclera
or
“
whites
of
the
eye
”
is
pretty
juicy
--
when
combined
with
the
eyeball
’s
fat
padding
and
surprising
amount
of
eyeball
flesh
,
the
result
can
be
extremely
tender
and
creamy
.

I
realize
creamy
is
probably
the
last
word
you
’d
expect
to
see
when
reading
a
description
of
a
cow
’s
eyeball
,
but
it
’s
true
,
at
least
when
the
eye
is
steamed
and
sautéed
.

However
,
after
the
ojo
taco
is
all
seasoned
with
chili
heat
and
put
together
into
the
tortilla
,
your
entire
perspective
on
cow
eyes
will
change
and
you
’ll
pronounce
the
eye
taco
as
“
ojo
so
good
!
”

Once
in
your
mouth
,
this
beef
eye
will
confuse
you
into
believing
that
you
are
eating
the
most
tender
of
braised
meats
when
in
fact
you
’re
reveling
in
pressure-cooked
pupil
.

I
did

to
see

1000
DAYS
OF
THEORY

Louis
Armstrong
International
Airport

(
a
post-Katrina
meditation
)

Richard
Carlson

The
sun
unfurls
its
noon
fury
in
the
Creole	B	Creole	Louisiana_Creole_cuisine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Creole_cuisine	000	000
heat
of
late
summer
.

One
walks
slowly
over
bare
tarmac
with
the
wavy
mirage
traces
of
jet
fuel

evaporating
from
the
baked
runway
.

Your
eyes
must
squint
to
distinguish
actual
form
from
hallucination
in
the
gaseous
blur
.

The
mugginess
is

palpable
and
steams
up
from
the
bayou
to
create
a
state
of
perpetual
humidity
,
you
strain
to
wipe
away
the
sweat
dripping
from
your
brow
on
the
balmy

Louisiana	B	Louisiana	Louisiana	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana	000	000
day
.

a
city
under
pressure
of
heat
and
moisture
,

Steam
condenses
on
your
tongue
as
you
try
to
speak
,
but
because
you
are
walking
quickly
you
think
again
and
feel
better
in
the
short
term
just
to

shield
your
nose
and
hold
your
breath
as
the
stench
of
rotting
waste
reaches
you
.

That
which
was
cast
off
by
mortal
flesh
,
and
that
once
consumed
by

human
mutely
decay
,
lay
in
steaming
piles
and
reek
in
the
clammy
gulf
coast
breeze
;

the
waste
having
not
been
removed
for
over
two
weeks
.

a
city
under
pressure
of
decomposition
,

The
concourse
which
once
facilitated
the
bustle
of
life
in
the
hyper-modernist
fast
lane
was
used
during
the
last
fortnight
as
a
triage
for
sorting

out
the
ill
and
as
a
morgue
for
the
dead
.

Sprawling
on
strands
of
cots
strung
out
along
the
terminal
's
vast
expanse
of
grimy
marble
floor
and
close

cropped
carpet
lay
the
injured
and
poor
black
folk
of
the
9th
ward
and
St
Bernard
's
Parish
,
making
themselves
as
comfortable
as
they
could
in
front
of

the
vacant
ticket
counters
,
gated
newspaper
stands
,
empty
coffee
joints
and
miscellaneous
jazz
paraphernalia
.

Transformed
from
a
place
which
housed
mere
travelers
into
a
hall
of
the
wholly
dispossessed
is

;
but
what
else
would

one
expect
?

The
child
of
a
New	B	New Orleans	New_Orleans	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans	000	000
Orleans	I	New Orleans	New_Orleans	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans	000	000
prostitute
,
Satchmo	B	Satchmo	Louis_Armstrong	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong	000	000
was
already
abandoned
and
then
arrested
at
the
age
of
six
.

What
else
would
one
expect
from
history
in
the
deep	B	deep South	Deep_South	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South	000	000
South	I	deep South	Deep_South	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South	000	000
,
only
now
being
staged
within
the
facade
of
an
international
airport
?

The
airport
,
that

bastion
of
globalization
which
makes
planetary
culture
possible
now
houses
the
distraught
and
dispossessed
,
the
discontented
and
dying
of
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
's

3rd

world
;
hermetically
sealed
within
its
own
environs
.

a
city
under
pressure
of
history
,

But
there
are
no
commercial
flights
taking
off
today
,
just
Blackhawk
helicopters
and
C-130s
involved
in
rescue
and
reconstruction
.

The
flow
of

commerce
has
been
halted
,
preempted
by
120
mph
winds
and
the
flood
.

The
forces
of
the
market
which
once
built
this
airport
reduced
to
a
trickle
,
this

port
city
and
hub
of
world
commerce
now
just
the
glean
in
the
eye
of
Haliburton
or
the
Shaw	B	Shaw Group	The_Shaw_Group	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shaw_Group	000	000
Group	I	Shaw Group	The_Shaw_Group	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shaw_Group	000	000
contemplating
the
future
potential
of
capital

ventures
and
returns
at
more
than
twenty
percent
.

a
city
at
the
mercy
of
military
industrial
carpetbaggers
,

One
walks
on
to
meet
the
air
traffic
control
manager
whose
disheveled
tower
is
now
in

disarray
and
overflowing
with
controllers
sleeping
on
air

mattresses
in
front
of
sophisticated
radar
arrays
and
advanced
navigation
systems
.

The
technology
which
made
this
airport
possible
is
temporarily
out

of
service
and
gathering
dust
.

The
wide
cherry
table
tops
of
conference
rooms
where
local
procedures
for
approach
control
and
the
divvying
up
of

airspace
were
once
decided
now
served
as
the
platform
to
place
k
rations
stale
coffee
and
half
eaten
donuts
.

ratiocination
and
technology
at
the
mercy
of
a
southern
tempest
,

All
the
technology
in
the
world
could
not
put
a
bandage
on
the
damage
done
by
the
storm
and
flood
to
get
operations
back
to
normal
sooner
.

The
warm

gulf
currents
which
fed
Katrina	B	Katrina	Hurricane_Katrina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina	000	000
were
only
heated
further
by
the
carbon
waste
spewed
from
oil
refineries
and
industry
along
the
coast
.

Already
no
match

for
a
category
four
hurricane
,
the
dredging
of
swamps
by
oil
companies
allowed
salt
water
to
seep
back
into
the
once
fertile
wetlands
which
now
yield

up
more
than
100
acres
a
day
to
the
sea
.

The
levees
of
the
mighty
river
denied
needed
silt
to
restore
the
earth
under
this
grand
old
city
which

allowed
it
to
nestle
safely
between
the
Mississippi	B	Mississippi	Mississippi	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi	000	000
and
Pontchartrain	B	Pontchartrain	Lake_Pontchartrain	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Pontchartrain	000	000
.

ratiocination
and
technology
at
the
mercy
of
blow-back
,

Those
bound
in
the

cyclic
of
history
of
domination
,
of
the
eternal
recurrence
of
the
underclass
,

are
those
most
effected
,
but
what
else
would
one

expect
,
here
in
the
deep	B	deep South	Deep_South	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South	000	000
South	I	deep South	Deep_South	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South	000	000
?

where
burnt
crosses
still
smolder
in
the
charcoal
heart
of
Dixie
,

and
can
suddenly
violently
alight

in
an
inferno
;

into
which
we
begin
our
descent
from
the
French	B	French Quarter	French_Quarter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Quarter	000	000
Quarter	I	French Quarter	French_Quarter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Quarter	000	000
.

This
is
a
city
which
could
just
as
easily
burn
while
being
martyred
for
the
sins
of
a
nation
,

but
this
is
the
city
in
the
time
of
flood
.

Here
now
reside
those
forced
to
the
fringes
of
our
society
,
those
who
live
below
sea
level
,
the
ones
who
do
not
partake
of
the
prosperity
of
this

Port	B	Port	Port	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port	000	000
economy
;
of
mid-western
grain
harvest
barges
,
trans-oceanic
container
ships
,
and
Gulf	B	Gulf	Gulf_Oil	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Oil	000	000
oil
rigs
.

These
folks
are
too
far
removed
from
the

mainstream
to
be
concerned
with
the
storm
's
effect
on
falling
world
markets
sparked
by
the
rising
price
of
gasoline
,
because
they
had
no
vehicles
to

evacuate
the
area
in
the
first
place
.

They
do
however
,
still
need
food
,
and
the
shopkeepers
have
all
left
for
higher
ground
.

Already
the
200
billion
dollar
reconstruction
being
planned
has
passed
legislation
and
funnels
funds
through
the
lobbyist
and
technocrat
directly

into
the
coffers
of
the
good
ol'
boys

and
multi-nationals
.

Yet
,
the
same
legislation
eliminated
the
Davis-Bacon
Act
and
the
minimum
wage
of
the

construction
laborer
.

But
what
else
would
one
expect
in
a
state
next
to
the
president
's
own
?

To
be
rebuilt
yet
again
,
but
now
upon
the
backs
of

descendent
's
of
slaves
of
the
Americas	B	Americas	Americas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas	000	000
both
North
and
South
.

But
now
a
tax
cut
and
a
debit
card
with
a
two
thousand
dollar
limit
will
have
to
serve
in

place
of
forty
acres
and
a
mule
.

carpetbaggers
conspiring
with
technology
,

Those
who
own
the
technology
and
resources
to
begin
construction
,
who
are
the
masters
of
calculating
the
market
forces
,
who
have
the
ear
of
the

vice
president
will
come
out
ahead
in
this
disaster
.

Old
low
lying
neighborhoods
will
be
bulldozed
and
then
gentrified
,
those
shining
glass
and
steel

structures
will
gleam
for
a
new
class
of
entrepreneurs
who
will
profit
from
the
Reconstruction	B	Reconstruction	Reconstruction_Era	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era	000	000
.

New
infra-structure
will
replace
the
rotting
old

wooden
front
porches
of
houses
built
during
the
Depression	B	Depression	Depression_(mood)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)	000	000
.

Law
and
order
will
be
haphazardly
restored
.

The
airport
will
have
its
waste
removed
,
the

concourses
cleared
of
patients
,
the
military
will
depart
its
taxiways
,
it
will
be
retooled
and
its
technology
will
reanimate
the

bayou
economy
to

once
again
fuel
the
oil
gluttony
of
the
global
village
,
even
as
the
corps
of
engineers
still
struggle
to
halt
the
progress
of
the
encroaching

wetlands

out
there

maybe
for

a

I

Plus
I

I

Maybe
CV	B	CV	Constant-velocity_joint	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant-velocity_joint	000	000
joints
or
bearings
or
???

I
am
still
trying
to
pin
point
where
the
noise
is
coming
from
but
it
is
a
rolling
type
of
scraping
I
thought
it
was
mud
in
the
rotors
or
something
but
I
have
got
ALL
of
the
mud
off
and
I
still
get
the
noise
.

Sounds

Right
side

I
am
gon
na
get
the
book
out
and
see
what
kind
of
checks
to
do
to
check
the
CV
joints
and
stuff
.

Hopefully
it
is
nothing
bad
.

I
can
not
get
it
to
the

Ca
n't

I

Yeah
,

so
I
confess
--
the
only
reason
I
was

drawn
to
Tokyo
Gore

Police
was
because
its
title
was
Tokyo
Gore
Police
.

But
I
did
know
a
bit
about
this
flick
before
diving
in
blind
;
namely

some
delightful
accusations
that
it
was
the
most
ball-tearing
Eastern

gore
flick
since
Riki-Oh
,
and
that
it
starred
Audition	B	Audition	Audition_(1999_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audition_(1999_film)	000	000
's

über-bitch
Eihi	B	Eihi Shiina	Eihi_Shiina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eihi_Shiina	000	000
Shiina	I	Eihi Shiina	Eihi_Shiina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eihi_Shiina	000	000
battling
it
out
with
a
katana
against

mutants
.

The
deal
,
as
they
say
,
was
sealed
.

Tokyo

Gore
Police
posits
a
futuristic
Tokyo	B	Tokyo	Tokyo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo	000	000
where
the
mean
streets
are

commandeered
by
the
"
Engineers
"
.

The
Engineers
are
the
hideously

mutated
products
of
macabre
human
experiments
in
which
people
are

infected
by
a
strain
of
DNA
synthesised
from
that
of
various
serial

killers
,
turning
them
into
homicidal
maniacs
.

The
Engineers
are
also

able
to
turn
any
injury
they
sustain
into
a
lethal
weapon
,
with
some

genuinely
repulsive
results
.

The
only
thing
that
stops
the
Engineers

entirely
is
the
severing
of
the
offending
strand
of
DNA
,
a
solid

key-shaped
growth
that
may
be
removed
upon
autopsy
.

Little
is
known

about
the
Engineers
and
the
only
obstacle
to
their
objective
of

unrelentingly
terrorising
the
streets
of
Tokyo	B	Tokyo	Tokyo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo	000	000
is
the
local
police

force
,
a
recently
privatised
behemoth
that
is
absolutely
ruthless
in

its
approach
to
the
mutants
.

The

stellar
member
of
Tokyo	B	Tokyo	Tokyo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo	000	000
's
boys
and
girls
in
blue
is
Ruka
(
Shiina
)
,

a
pretty
young
thing
who
's
pretty
handy
with
a
samurai
sword
.

Ruka

is
haunted
by
the
murder
of
her
father
,
a
Tokyo	B	Tokyo	Tokyo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo	000	000
cop
who
was
brutally

gunned
down
in
the
streets
,
and
she
is
set
on
finding
his
assassin
in

amongst
the
various
arse-kickery
that
comes
with
cleaning
the
streets

of
mutants
that
would
make
the
X-Men	B	X-Men	X-Men	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men	000	000
wince
.

Her
investigations
lead

her
to
the
"
Key
Man
"
,
who
is
deeply
involved
with
both
her

father
's
murder
and
the
Engineers
.

The

director
of
Tokyo
Gore
Police
is
Yoshihiro	B	Yoshihiro Nishimura	Yoshihiro_Nishimura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Nishimura	000	000
Nishimura	I	Yoshihiro Nishimura	Yoshihiro_Nishimura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Nishimura	000	000
,
who

gained
tremendous
cult
acclaim
with
his
special
effects
work
on
the

2008
film
The
Machine
Girl
.

The
roots
of
Tokyo
Gore
Police
began
with

the

,
when
they
suggested
Nishimura	B	Nishimura	Yoshihiro_Nishimura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Nishimura	000	000
helm

own
feature
.

Nishimura	B	Nishimura	Yoshihiro_Nishimura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Nishimura	000	000
opted
to
remake
one
of
his
short
films
,
the
1995
flick

.

Sakaguchi	I	Tak Sakaguchi	Tak_Sakaguchi	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tak_Sakaguchi	000	000
,
best
known
in
cult
circles

for
his
starring
role
in
Ryuhei	B	Ryuhei Kitamura	Ryuhei_Kitamura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryuhei_Kitamura	000	000
Kitamura	I	Ryuhei Kitamura	Ryuhei_Kitamura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryuhei_Kitamura	000	000

was

brought

choreographer
and
Nishimura	B	Nishimura	Yoshihiro_Nishimura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Nishimura	000	000
assembled
a
cult
star

cast
,
including
Shiina	B	Shiina	Eihi_Shiina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eihi_Shiina	000	000
.

If

you
're
expecting
anything
remotely
coherent
,
Tokyo
Gore
Police
is
n't
the
movie
for
you
;
perhaps
it
's
best
thought
of
as
the

hell-spawn
of
Cronenberg	B	Cronenberg	David_Cronenberg	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cronenberg	000	000
and
Miike	B	Miike	Takashi_Miike	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takashi_Miike	000	000
,
with
a
dollop
of
Lynch
.

Nishimura	B	Nishimura	Yoshihiro_Nishimura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Nishimura	000	000

has
adopted
for
a
"
low
on
brains
,
high
on
brawn
"
approach
,
and
by

God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
is
it
high
on
brawn
--
when
the
claret
is
spilled
it
rivals
Braindead	B	Braindead	Braindead_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braindead_(film)	000	000
for
sheer
viscera
and
the
comparisons
to
Riki-Oh
are
more
than
valid
.

Unfortunately
,
the
absolutely
threadbare

plot
is
frequently
lost
in
the
pink
mist
(
or
rather
deep-red
showers
;

it
's
the
House
of
Blue
Leaves
in
colour
,
for
105
minutes
)
and
a

major
fault
is
that
it
's
just
too
long
.

About
twenty
minutes
could

have
easily
been
shorn
off
the
running
time
to
make
Tokyo

Gore
Police
a
very
lean
,
mean
little
exercise
in
bloodshed
.

Nishimura
errs
on
the
side
of
self-indulgence
and
just
before
the

hyper-frenetic
conclusion
finally
kicks
in
it
's
beginning
to
get
a

little
tiresome
.

Something

should
be
said
here
about
the
social
commentary
that
is
so
central
to
Tokyo
Gore
Police
and
makes
up
a
lot
of
its
charm
.

Nishimura	B	Nishimura	Yoshihiro_Nishimura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Nishimura	000	000

has
peppered
fake
advertisements
throughout
the
film
,
some
boasting

the
sheer
sadistic
prowess
of
the
police
in
their
Darth	B	Darth Vader	Darth_Vader	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader	000	000
Vader	I	Darth Vader	Darth_Vader	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader	000	000

get-ups
,
others
advertising
razors
that
are
easier
to
self-mutilate

with
.

While
the
parallels
to
Starship	B	Starship Troopers	Starship_Troopers_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers_(film)	000	000
Troopers	I	Starship Troopers	Starship_Troopers_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers_(film)	000	000
are
clear
,

Nishimura	B	Nishimura	Yoshihiro_Nishimura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Nishimura	000	000
does
a
really
good
job
with
them
for
the
most
part
--

they
're
incredibly
blackly
funny
and
do
the
whole
satirical
bit

quite
well
.

The
only
input
Nishimura	B	Nishimura	Yoshihiro_Nishimura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Nishimura	000	000
had
in
these
segments
was

supervision
and
make-up
effects
.

Instead
,
they
were
directed
by

Noboru
"
The
Machine
Girl
"
Iguchi
and
Yûdai
Yamaguchi
,

director
of
the

In
one

interview
,
Nishimura	B	Nishimura	Yoshihiro_Nishimura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Nishimura	000	000
said
his
main
reasoning
behind
including
the

advertisements
was
to
lighten
the
tone
of
the
picture
and
his
desire

to
make
some
sort
of
social
comment
drawing
upon
his
legal
college

education
.

Nishimura	B	Nishimura	Yoshihiro_Nishimura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Nishimura	000	000
's

own
special
effects
mob
Nishimura
Motion
Picture
Model
Makers
Group

is
responsible
for
the
special
effects
and
for
the
most
part
they
're

done
really
well
.

Some
of
these
creatures
are
disgusting
,
nightmarish

things
and
that
's
a
real
testament
to
Nishimura	B	Nishimura	Yoshihiro_Nishimura	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Nishimura	000	000
's
company
's

creativity
--
particular
kudos
goes
towards
the
crocodile
mermaid

and
,
to
paraphrase
the
irate
cop
from
The
Doors
,
"
the
guy

with
the
brain
"
.

In

amongst
all
of
the
madness
,
the
incoherence
,
the
blood
and
satire
,
Tokyo
Gore
Police
is
a
pretty
good
film
.

Even
though
it

outstays
its
welcome
at
105
minutes
,
it
's
a
quirky
Japanese	B	Japanese	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000
riff
on

Cronenbergian
body
horror
and
the
Eastern
blood
movie
that
's
well

worth
your
time
.

Video

Picture
is
presented
in
1:85:1
,
with
16:9
enhancement
.

Although
obviously
shot
on
video
,
the
image
is
very
clear
.

No
complaints
here
.

Audio

A
fair
smorgasbord
of
audio
tracks
are
available
depending
on
your
technological
capabilities
or
language
preference
--
two
Japanese	B	Japanese	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000
Dolby	B	Dolby	Dolby_Laboratories	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Laboratories	000	000
tracks
in
2.0
and
5.1
and
two
English	B	English	England	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England	000	000
Dolby	B	Dolby	Dolby_Laboratories	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Laboratories	000	000
tracks
in
2.0
and
5.1
.

I
'm
dead-set
against
the
inferior
dubbed
tracks
so
the
Japanese	B	Japanese	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000
5.1
was
the
way
to
go
for
me
and
it
sounded
terrific
.

English	B	English	England	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England	000	000
subtitles
are
also
provided
.

Extra
Features

This
disc
is
light
on
extras
--
a
theatrical
trailer
,
extended
promo
trailer
and
stills
gallery
have
been
provided
.

However
,
the
US
Media
Blasters
disc
is
lighter
still
,
including
only
a
theatrical
trailer
.

The
local
release
is
the
way
to
go
at
the
moment
.

The
Verdict

A
wildly
entertaining
film
,
even
if
it
's
just
for
the
sheer
spectacle
of
the
thing
.

It
gets
a
bit
tired
towards
the
middle
and
when
exploring
some
very
impossible
connections
between
the
Key
Man
and
Ruka
,
but
hey
--
it
's
grisly
,
ultra-violent
Japanese	B	Japanese	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000
mayhem
at
its
delirious
high
point
.

Oh
,
did
I
mention
there
were
mutants
?

Good
review
.

I
preferred
MACHINE	B	MACHINE GIRL	The_Machine_Girl	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machine_Girl	000	000
GIRL	I	MACHINE GIRL	The_Machine_Girl	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Machine_Girl	000	000
in
some
ways
,
but
perhaps
because
it
was
tighter
.

TOKYO	B	TOKYO GORE POLICE	Tokyo_Gore_Police	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Gore_Police	000	000
GORE	I	TOKYO GORE POLICE	Tokyo_Gore_Police	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Gore_Police	000	000
POLICE	I	TOKYO GORE POLICE	Tokyo_Gore_Police	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Gore_Police	000	000
is
great
fun
,
but
is
way
overlong
.

Godzilla
#

Godzilla	B	Godzilla	Godzilla	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla	000	000
was
over
100
feet
tall
and
immensely
strong
and
durable
.

He
had
a
semi-prehensile
tail
and
had
human
level
dexterity
in
his
hands
and
use
of
his
arms
.

He
was
amphibious
and
could
expel
radioactive
flame
from
his
mouth
at
will
.

He
demonstrated
a
near-human
level
of
intelligence
and
understanding
.

He
was
later
mutated
into
a
more
amphibious
form
,
and
it
is
not
certain
how
this
affected
his
abilities
.

He
has
not
be
seen
to
use
his
radioactive
flame
in
this
form
.

Godzilla
is
believed
to
be
a
dinosaur
who
somehow
survived
in
an
inert
form
below
the
surface
of
the
ocean
until
the
modern
era
.

He
is
believed
to
have
been
mutated
by
nuclear
weapons
testing
.

It
is
also
possible
that
Godzilla	B	Godzilla	Godzilla	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla	000	000
is
actually
a
mutate
created
by
the
Deviants
of
Lemuria
,
as
many
of
the
other
giant
monsters
from
his
era
have
been
found
to
be
active
over
several
of
the
last
decades
.

For
instance
,
the
Deviants
created
a
race
of
dinosaurs
that
dwell
in
Wakanda	B	Wakanda	Wakanda_(comics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakanda_(comics)	000	000
.

Godzilla
was
first
seen
when
he
surfaced
off
the
coast
of
Japan	B	Japan	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000
in
1956
,
during
nuclear
testing
.

Dr.
Yuriko
Takaguchi
was
present
during
this
testing
as
a
passive
resistant
and
witnessed
Godzilla	B	Godzilla	Godzilla	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla	000	000
's

smile

"

I
have
my
circle

and
I
know
who
to
trust
and
who
not
to
trust
,
"
Green	B	Green	A._J._Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Green	000	000
said
.
"

I
’m
at
the
point
of
my
life
right
now
that
I
do
n’t
need
to
make
any
new
friends
.

I
’ve
got
to
keep
that
same
circle
I
’ve
had
since
Day
1
and
not
let
anybody
in
that
.
"

How
refreshing
it
is
to
read
a
statement
like
this
from
a
college
football
player
who
just
“
gets
it
.
”

AJ	B	AJ	Arana_Taumata	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arana_Taumata	000	000
has
conducted
himself
with
class
from
the
very
beginning
at
Georgia	B	Georgia	Georgia_Bulldogs_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football	000	000
.

We
’ve
never
heard
his
name
tossed
around
with
any
kind
of
arrest
or
behavior
issue
,
and
he
’s
done
nothing
but
make
us
proud
again
.

His
biggest
faux-pas
so
far
was
his
“
celebration
”
against
LSU	B	LSU	LSU_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football	000	000
last
year
,
and
we
all
know
how
that
went
.

If
every
player
used
this
kind
of
common
sense
in
who
they
let
interact
with
them
during
their
college
career
and
leading
up
to
the
draft
,
there
would
be
a
lot
fewer
instances
like
SouthBeachOMGSOFUN-gate
going
on
right
now
.

of
Frittering

Some
people
come
into
money
and
fritter
it
away
--
others
have
a
knack
for
turning
money
into
more
money
.

Jim	B	Jim Lindsey	Jim_Lindsey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lindsey	000	000
Lindsey	I	Jim Lindsey	Jim_Lindsey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lindsey	000	000
graduated
from
high
school
in
Forest
City
,
Ark.	B	Ark.	Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas	000	000
,
in
1962
.

He
went
on
to
the
University	B	University of Arkansas	University_of_Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arkansas	000	000
of	I	University of Arkansas	University_of_Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arkansas	000	000
Arkansas	I	University of Arkansas	University_of_Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arkansas	000	000
and
played
football
under
Coach
Frank	B	Frank Broyles	Frank_Broyles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Broyles	000	000
Broyles	I	Frank Broyles	Frank_Broyles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Broyles	000	000
.

As
a
6-2
,
210
tailback
,
he
helped
the
Razorbacks	B	Razorbacks	Razorback	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razorback	000	000
become
national
champions
in
1964
.

And
by
the
time
he
graduated
in
1965
,
they
had
won
22
games
in
a
row
.

In
1966
,
Lindsey	B	Lindsey	Jim_Lindsey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lindsey	000	000
was
drafted
in
the
second
round
by
the
Minnesota	B	Minnesota Vikings	Minnesota_Vikings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings	000	000
Vikings	I	Minnesota Vikings	Minnesota_Vikings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings	000	000
under
Coach
Norm	B	Norm Van Brocklin	Norm_Van_Brocklin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Van_Brocklin	000	000
Van	I	Norm Van Brocklin	Norm_Van_Brocklin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Van_Brocklin	000	000
Brocklin	I	Norm Van Brocklin	Norm_Van_Brocklin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Van_Brocklin	000	000
.

Bud	B	Bud Grant	Bud_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Grant	000	000
Grant	I	Bud Grant	Bud_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Grant	000	000
was
hired
to
replace
Van	B	Van Brocklin	Norm_Van_Brocklin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Van_Brocklin	000	000
Brocklin	I	Van Brocklin	Norm_Van_Brocklin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Van_Brocklin	000	000
in
1967
and
Lindsey	B	Lindsey	Jim_Lindsey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lindsey	000	000
fit
right
in
the
new
coach
's
system
as
a
role
player
(
backup
running
back
and
tight
end
)
and
soon
became
special
team
's
captain
on
all
the
kicking
plays
.

Lindsey	B	Lindsey	Jim_Lindsey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lindsey	000	000
was
a
marginal
offensive
player
for
the
Vikings	B	Vikings	Minnesota_Vikings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings	000	000
,
ever
fearful
he
would
n't
make
the
team
.

He
rushed
for
a
total
of
566
yards
and
six
touchdowns
,
and
received
65
passes
for
632
yards
and
four
touchdowns
over
seven
seasons
.

But
on
special
teams
he
was
invaluable
at
breaking
up
wedges
on
kickoffs
and
covering
punts
.

Having
played
for
Frank	B	Frank Broyles	Frank_Broyles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Broyles	000	000
Broyles	I	Frank Broyles	Frank_Broyles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Broyles	000	000
in
college
,
Lindsey	B	Lindsey	Jim_Lindsey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lindsey	000	000
developed
a
deep
appreciation
of
coaching
.

Throughout
his
seven
years
in
pro
football
,
Lindsey	B	Lindsey	Jim_Lindsey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lindsey	000	000
always
assumed
he
would
someday
be
a
football
coach
,
probably
at
the
high
school
level
somewhere
in
Arkansas	B	Arkansas	Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas	000	000
or
perhaps
even
back
at
his
college
alma
mater
.

As
a
second
round
draft
pick
back
in
1966
,
Lindsey	B	Lindsey	Jim_Lindsey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lindsey	000	000
signed
a
three-year
deal
with
the
Vikings	B	Vikings	Minnesota_Vikings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Vikings	000	000
which
paid
an
annual
salary
of
$
25,000
in
the
first
year
,
$
27,500
the
second
year
and
$
30,000
the
third
year
.

He
also
received
a
signing
bonus
of
$
90.000
.

After
taxes
,
the
up-front
cash
bonus
had
been
reduced
to
$
60,000
.

Lindsey	B	Lindsey	Jim_Lindsey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lindsey	000	000
was
a
small-town
kid
who
majored
in
math
in
college
.

Instead
of
frittering
away
his
fresh
wad
of
cash
on
instant
frills
(
cars
,
jewelry
,
etc.
)
,
he
made
a
$
60,000
down
payment
on
a
$
167,000
chunk
of
Arkansas	B	Arkansas	Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas	000	000
land
.

Payments
on
the
land
came
out
of
his
salary
while
he
and
his
wife
lived
modestly
in
a
rented
apartment
.

Three
years
after
purchasing
the
land
,
he
sold
it
for
$
1.5
million
.

Lindsey	B	Lindsey	Jim_Lindsey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lindsey	000	000
never
did
get
into
coaching
,
but
he
did
start
a
real
estate
investment
company
in
Fayetteville	B	Fayetteville	Fayetteville,_Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fayetteville,_Arkansas	000	000
called
Lindsey
&
Associates
,
plus
he
currently
serves
on
the
Board
of
Trustees
at
the
University	B	University of Arkansas	University_of_Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arkansas	000	000
of	I	University of Arkansas	University_of_Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arkansas	000	000
Arkansas	I	University of Arkansas	University_of_Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arkansas	000	000
as
chairman
of
the
athletic
committee
.

Presently
,
Lindsey	B	Lindsey	Jim_Lindsey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lindsey	000	000
owns
27,500
apartment
units
,
12,000
acres
of
farmland
and
28
golf
courses
.

Not
including
income
from
the
apartment
building
operation
(
which
is
spread
over
the
Ozarks	B	Ozarks	Ozarks	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozarks	000	000

last
year
.

Jerry	B	Jerry Jones	Jerry_Jones	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones	000	000
Jones	I	Jerry Jones	Jerry_Jones	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones	000	000
,
owner
of
the
Dallas	B	Dallas Cowboys	Dallas_Cowboys	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys	000	000
Cowboys	I	Dallas Cowboys	Dallas_Cowboys	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys	000	000
,
was
also
a
member
of
the
University	B	University of Arkansas	University_of_Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arkansas	000	000
of	I	University of Arkansas	University_of_Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arkansas	000	000
Arkansas	I	University of Arkansas	University_of_Arkansas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arkansas	000	000
football
team
at
the
same
time
as
Lindsey	B	Lindsey	Jim_Lindsey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lindsey	000	000
.

He
and
Lindsey
are
currently
embarking
on
a
five-year
project
to
construct
5,000
apartment
units
,
at
a
cost
of
$
50
million
,
on
270
acres
in
the
Dallas	B	Dallas	Dallas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas	000	000
area
.

And
the
rich
get
richer
once
again
.

Unless
you
're
born
into
it
,
money
is
hard
to
come
by
in
this
world
,
especially
if
you
have
to
work
for
someone
else
.

If
you
start
your
own
business
it
's
even
harder
because
it
requires
a
personal
commitment
,
diligence
and
plenty
of
good
luck
along
the
way
.

And
no
matter
how
much
effort
you
put
into
it
,
success
is
never
guaranteed
.

So
if
you
suddenly
acquire
a
large
sum
of
cash
,
do
n't
fritter
it
away
on
flashy
goodies
or
get-rich-quick
schemes
--
invest
it
wisely
in
something
worthwhile
,
such
as
real
property
or
furthering
your
own
enterprise
.

If
you
define
success
by
the
size
of
your
bankroll
,
you
need
to
follow
certain
steps
,
starting
with
a
long-term
plan
.

Then
be
prepared
to
sacrifice
personal
luxury
,
remain
persistent
and
have
the
patience
to
see
it
through
.

Personally
,
I
believe
success
is
being
content
with
everyday
life
,
regardless
of
the
surrounding
insanity
.

I
've
solved
all
my
money
problems
the
easy
way
--
by
not
having
very
much
of
it
;
just
enough
to
maintain
a
debt-free
existence
and
never
any
extra
money
to
fritter
away
on
anything
beyond
the
bare
necessities
of
life
.

To
fritter
or
not
to
fritter
,
that
is
the
question
.

But
it
's
only
a
dilemma
if
you
have
more
money
than
you
need
.

)
,
also
known
by
its
local
acronym
IKMB
,
is
a
fully-automated
electronic
trading
exchange
listing
equities
and
debt
securities
.

The
ISE	B	ISE	Borsa_Istanbul	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsa_Istanbul	000	000
's
benchmark
stock
index
rallied
significantly
in
2009
after
suffering
a
major
downturn
in
2008
following
the
global
financial
crisis
,
and
began
trading
a
new
joint
index
for
Turkish	B	Turkish	Turkey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey	000	000
and
Greek	B	Greek	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
equities
.

Background

The
ISE	B	ISE	Borsa_Istanbul	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsa_Istanbul	000	000
was
launched
in
1985
and
began
trading
securities
publicly
in
1986
.

In
1987
,
the
exchange
commenced
publishing
its
benchmark
stock
index
,
the
ISE-100
(
also
called
the
IMKB	B	IMKB	Borsa_Istanbul	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsa_Istanbul	000	000
-100
)
on
a
daily
instead
of
weekly
basis
,
and
in
1994
the
ISE	B	ISE	Borsa_Istanbul	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsa_Istanbul	000	000
switched
to
fully-automated
electronic
trading
.

Six
years
later
following
a
wave
of
global
stock
market
demutualizations
,
the
ISE	B	ISE	Borsa_Istanbul	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsa_Istanbul	000	000
took
a
27.4
percent
stake
in
the
Baku	B	Baku Stock Exchange	Baku_Stock_Exchange	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku_Stock_Exchange	000	000
Stock	I	Baku Stock Exchange	Baku_Stock_Exchange	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku_Stock_Exchange	000	000

in
Azerbaijan	B	Azerbaijan	Azerbaijan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan	000	000
and
a
5.26
percent
stake
in
the
Kyrgyz
Stock
Exchange
in
Kyrgyzstan	B	Kyrgyzstan	Kyrgyzstan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan	000	000
.

[

Following
several
years
of
strong
market
growth
,
the
ISE	B	ISE	Borsa_Istanbul	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsa_Istanbul	000	000
was
slammed
in
2008
by
the
global
financial
crisis
and
saw
its
total
market
capitalization
fall
by
more
than
half
from
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
$
288
billion
at
the
end
of
2007
to
just
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
$
118
billion
one
year
later
.

Over
the
same
period
,
the
benchmark
ISE-100
index
also
dropped
by
more
than
half
,
from
55,538
points
in
2007
to
26,864
in
2008
.

[

]
By
the
end
of
2008
,
317
listed
Tukish
companies
and
nine
Turkish	B	Turkish	Turkey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey	000	000
exchange-traded
funds
(
ETFs
)
were
listed
on
the
ISE	B	ISE	Borsa_Istanbul	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsa_Istanbul	000	000
.

In
mid-October
2009
the
ISE	B	ISE	Borsa_Istanbul	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsa_Istanbul	000	000
and
its
Greek	B	Greek	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
counterpart
,
the
Athens	B	Athens Stock Exchange	Athens_Exchange	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens_Exchange	000	000

(
Athex	B	Athex	Athens_Exchange	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens_Exchange	000	000
)
,
officially
launched
the
Greece-Turkey
30
Index
(
GT-30
)
as
a
benchmark
index
for
their
markets
combined
.

[

]
The
GT-30
is
a
STOXX
customized
index
consisting
of
the
15
companies
with
the
highest
market
capitalization
on
each
exchange
,
calculated
in
Turkish	B	Turkish	Turkey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey	000	000
lira
and
euros
.

[

]
Its
development
and
launch
was
the
result
of
long-term
co-operation
between
the
two
exchanges
,
which
had
received
applications
to
develop
exchange-traded
funds
(
ETFs
)
based
on
the
GT-30
.

By
mid-December
2009
the
ISE	B	ISE	Borsa_Istanbul	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsa_Istanbul	000	000
had
recovered
some
of
its
losses
from
the
previous
year
,
with
the
ISE-100
standing
at
just
over
31,600
,
a
gain
of
17.2
percent
on
the
year
and
a
22
percent
rise
since
April
.

[
5
]
The
index
crossed
the
200-day
moving
average
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
a
year
.

In
November
2011
,
plans
were
announced
for
a
merger
between
Turkey	B	Turkey	Turkey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey	000	000
's
two
largest
exchanges
,
ISE	B	ISE	Borsa_Istanbul	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borsa_Istanbul	000	000
and
TurkDEX	B	TurkDEX	TurkDex	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurkDex	000	000
.

CEO
Huseyin
Erkan
also
announced
at
that
time
that
he
would
step
down
due
to
a
new
law
passed
by
the
Turkish	B	Turkish	Turkey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey	000	000
government
,
giving
the
capital
city

the
power
to

From
Audio
Basics
,
July
,
1982
Hello
again
,
I
am
glad
that
the
feedback
I
am
getting
from
many
of
you
indicates
that
you
are
happy
with
the
information
and
ideas
I
have
been
describing
.

Some
of
you
have
complained
that
you
want
more
"
meat
"
-
technical
information
on
audio
equipment
.

So
,
this
month
we
will
get
a
bit
more
technical
and
go
through
the
operation
of
a
vacuum
tube
amplifier
,
what
it
does
,
what
it
can
not
do
,
and
what
you
can
do
about
it
.

The
data
will
pertain
to
vacuum
tube
amplifiers
in
general
,
and
the
Dyna
St-70
specifically
,
as
we
get
so
many
requests
for
information
on
how
to
modify
them
.

VACUUM
TUBE
AMPLIFIERS
Any
audio
amplifier
can
essentially
be
modeled
as
a
two
stage
device
;
a
voltage
amplifier
(
which
amplifies
the
amplitude
of
the
signal
)
followed
by
a
current
amplifier
(
which
supplies
the
drive
current
to
drive
the
now
large
amplitude
signal
into
a
low
impedance
load
-
the
speaker
system
)
.

Although
many
tube
circuits
will
also
have
voltage
gain
in
the
current
amplifier
section
,
that
is
not
important
to
the
discussion
that
follows
.

The
closed
loop
gain
of
the
amplifier
is
determined
by
a
voltage
divider
which
sends
a
portion
of
the
output
signal
back
to
the
input
of
the
voltage
amplifier
out
of
phase
.

The
amplifier
then
does
not
amplify
the
input
signal
,
it
amplifies
a
signal
being
the
difference
between
input
and
feedback
signal
.

If
the
voltage
amplifier
and
current
amplifier
were
perfectly
linear
,
the
difference
between
the
input
and
feedback
signal
would
be
only
a
small
version
of
the
input
signal
and
the
results
would
be
"
perfect
.
"

In
theory
,
any
difference
between
input
and
output
is
supposed
to
be
eliminated
by
feedback
.

The
feedback
signal
,
which
is
a
duplicate
of
the
output
signal
,
when
subtracted
from
the
input
signal
,
should
create
a
"
difference
signal
"
which
is
"
pre-distorted
"
by
the
amount
of
distortion
in
the
circuits
,
but
out
of
phase
with
the
circuit
's
distortion
.

The
"
pre-distortion
"
in
the
"
difference
"
signal
,
when
added
out
of
phase
to
the
actual
distortion
in
the
circuits
,
cancels
exactly
,
giving
a
"
perfect
"
output
signal
.

That
is
the
way
it
is
supposed
to
work
.

By
the
way
,
there
ai
n't
no
such
thing
as
a
no
feedback
amplifier
!

There
are
many
different
feedback
schemes
.

One
can
choose
to
use
lots
of
local
feedback
in
each
stage
and
little
overall
loop
feedback
,
but
each
device
in
itself
(
whether
it
is
transistor
or
tube
)
has
internal
feedback
.

If
one
attempts
to
make
an
amplifier
with
"
no
feedback
"
except
for
that
inherent
in
the
devices
themselves
then
the
design
becomes
absolutely
dependent
of
the
characteristics
of
each
independent
device
.

No
two
tubes
or
transistors
,
even
of
the
same
type
,
are
identical
.

Even
if
you
painstakingly
select
and
bias
each
individual
device
one
at
a
time
,
its
characteristics
will
change
with
variations
in
temperature
,
current
,
voltage
,
and
age
.

It
will
be
impossible
to
make
any
two
channels
the
same
and
to
keep
them
the
same
.

The
main
characteristics
of
a
so
called
"
no
feedback
"
amplifier
are
:
very
high
cost
(
each
unit
is
essentially
a
one
off
)
,
very
hot
running
as
the
devices
have
to
be
biased
on
very
hard
,
unstable
operation
as
the
unit
changes
characteristics
with
age
and
temperature
,
no
two
samples
will
sound
the
same
as
they
are
device
dependent
,
and
lots
of
"
blow-ups
.
"

Obviously
,
repairs
will
be
expensive
as
a
repair
is
essentially
a
re-engineering
of
that
unit
with
new
devices
and
re-biasing
of
each
device
.

I
can
live
without
it
.

The
"
wonderful
"
sound
of
a
"
no
feedback
"
amplifier
is
the
wonderful
sound
of
lots
of
instabilities
and
underdamped
oscillations
.

You
may
like
it
,
I
do
n't
,
it
is
n't
music
.

Thus
,
those
that
choose
to
build
stable
,
repeatable
,
and
rationally
priced
amplifiers
will
use
some
feedback
.

The
catch
is
in
knowing
what
the
feedback
can
and
can
not
do
in
the
real
world
,
and
to
use
the
feedback
properly
,
so
that
the
unit
does
not
only
measure
well
,
but
actually
performs
well
under
transient
conditions
in
the
real
world
.

Now
,
back
to
that
vacuum
tube
amplifier
.

Remember
we
mentioned
that
if
the
voltage
amplifier
and
the
current
amplifier
were
perfect
,
everything
would
be
just
fine
.

Sorry
folks
,
the
internal
circuits
are
not
perfect
and
that
is
where
the
troubles
start
.

Inasmuch
as
the
feedback
is
supposed
to
compensate
for
any
non-linearities
between
input
and
output
,
it
is
nice
to
know
what
non-linearities
exist
.

First
of
all
each
individual
active
device
is
nonlinear
.

Its
transfer
characteristics
are
exponential
,
not
linear
,
be
it
tube
,
FET	B	FET	Field-effect_transistor	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-effect_transistor	000	000
,
or
transistor
.

Refer
to
the
sketches
below
.

If
the
device
was
perfect
,
its
transfer
function
would
be
a
straight
line
,
and
the
slope
would
remain
the
same
at
all
frequencies
.

The
actual
characteristics
are
shown
in
the
second
and
third
sketches
.

Note
that
the
characteristics
are
actually
exponential
.

The
device
is
only
very
linear
near
the
center-line
of
its
operation
,
and
the
harder
it
is
"
worked
"
,
the
less
linear
it
becomes
,
finally
becoming
100
%
nonlinear
when
its
absolute
limitations
are
reached
.

In
addition
,
the
slope
of
the
transfer
function
becomes
less
at
higher
frequencies
as
the
gain
of
the
device
reduces
.

Thus
if
one
attempts
to
get
the
same
output
from
any
given
device
at
higher
frequency
,
one
will
drive
it
into
gross
non-linearity
sooner
,
as
its
headroom
is
less
.

In
a
similar
fashion
,
at
very
low
frequencies
(
approaching
DC	B	DC	Direct_current	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current	000	000
)
the
device
becomes
more
nonlinear
and
its
gain
drops
.

In
addition
,
because
the
slope
changes
with
frequency
,
a
kind
of
phase
distortion
is
introduced
which
is
not
measured
in
standard
IHF
distortion
tests
,
which
measure
only
single
frequency
performance
.

Obviously
,
to
optimize
internal
linearity
,
it
is
very
desirable
to
operate
each
device
within
as
narrow
a
bandwidth
and
as
limited
an
amplitude
range
as
possible
while
still
covering
the
audio
frequency
range
of
interest
.

In
a
vacuum
tube
amplifier
another
major
non-linearity
is
the
output
transformer
.

The
output
transformer
's
primary
coil
is
just
that-a
very
large
coil
(
inductor
)
in
series
with
the
output
tubes
.

Obviously
the
coil
becomes
very
resistive
as
the
frequency
goes
up
,
and
in
an
audio
amplifier
this
happens
well
within
the
audio
range
,
rolling
off
the
high
frequency
output
.

At
very
low
frequencies
the
core
of
the
transformer
saturates
giving
very
nonlinear
bass
performance
.

If
one
wants
good
high
frequency
performance
then
one
must
have
very
small
output
transformers
so
that
the
coil
inductance
is
low
.

If
one
wants
good
low
frequency
performance
one
must
have
very
large
transformers
so
the
core
does
not
saturate
.

These
requirements
are
mutually
self
exclusive
.

These
requirements
become
more
difficult
to
meet
as
the
power
rating
goes
up
.

If
one
attempts
to
"
get
around
"
this
by
designing
a
tube
amplifier
without
output
transformers
,
then
one
is
faced
with
the
problem
that
output
tubes
have
very
high
output
impedance
and
will
not
drive
normal
loudspeaker
loads
(
8
s
nominal
)
without
severe
non-linearities
.

Since
the
output
transformer
is
a
very
narrow
band
and
nonlinear
device
,
it
is
obviously
necessary
to
not
feed
into
the
transformer
a
signal
that
it
can
not
handle-the
bandwidth
of
the
amplifier
must
be
limited
to
within
the
bandwidth
of
the
output
transformer
.

You
can
not
stuff
10
pounds
in
a
1
pound
sack
.

The
power
supply
is
another
source
of
distortion
.

The
power
supply
can
be
considered
to
be
in
series
with
and
part
of
the
output
circuit
.

All
current
that
flows
through
the
output
circuit
and
speaker
load
first
must
flow
through
the
power
supply
.

The
frequency
limits
of
a
power
supply
are
real
.

It
can
be
modeled
as
an
inductor
in
series
with
a
capacitor
.

Obviously
at
DC	B	DC	Direct_current	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current	000	000
the
capacitor
's
impedance
is
infinitely
high
,
and
at
high
frequencies
the
inductance
is
infinitely
high
.

Thus
,
at
very
low
and
very
high
frequencies
,
the
power
supply
is
not
capable
at
all
.

Unless
great
care
is
used
in
the
power
supply
design
,
it
may
have
multiple
resonances
,
and
actually
be
high
impedance
at
many
frequencies
within
the
audio
range
.

Consider
also
that
since
the
power
supply
is
part
of
the
output
circuit
,
if
somebody
offers
a
"
wonderful
"
vacuum
tube
amplifier
with
a
"
wonderful
"
solid
state
power
supply
,
you
no
longer
have
a
vacuum
tube
amplifier
,
but
a
solid
state
amplifier
,
so
how
can
it
be
a
"
wonderful
"
tube
amplifier
?

Of
course
the
power
supply
is
also
attached
to
the
voltage
amplifier
section
.

Consider
that
all
current
draw
by
the
output
section
causes
a
signal
to
show
up
on
the
power
supply
feeds
.

Any
given
device
or
circuit
will
work
best
when
its
supply
is
absolutely
stable
.

Circuits
are
designed
to
reject
power
supply
variations
,
but
the
supply
rejection
is
n't
absolute
.

Thus
the
more
signal
that
shows
up
on
the
power
supply
feed
to
the
voltage
amplifier
,
the
more
distortion
and
instabilities
there
will
be
,
as
this
is
a
signal
injected
into
the
circuit
at
the
wrong
place
.

Since
we
already
know
that
the
power
supply
is
less
effective
at
very
high
and
very
low
frequencies
,
obviously
the
power
supply
related
distortions
will
be
greater
at
very
high
and
very
low
frequencies
.

Again
,
a
very
good
reason
to
bandwidth
limit
the
amplifier
to
within
the
capability
of
its
power
supply
.

Understand
of
course
that
we
are
considering
basic
ground
rules
in
general
.

There
are
many
different
kinds
of
voltage
amplifier
and
current
amplifier
configurations
that
work
fairly
well
,
some
simple
,
some
complex
.

The
important
thing
to
know
is
that
unless
the
circuits
are
executed
to
obey
the
guidelines
established
above
the
distortion
will
be
very
high
under
real
world
conditions
,
no
matter
what
the
linearity
of
each
section
is
and
no
matter
how
high
a
quality
of
parts
are
used
.

Another
common
problem
with
vacuum
tube
amplifiers
is
the
value
chosen
for
the
interstage
coupling
capacitors
.

In
the
case
of
the
Dynaco
St-70
for
example
(
see
attached
schematic
)
coupling
capacitors
C10	B	C10	Chevrolet_C/K	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_C/K	000	000
and
C11	B	C11	Mercedes-Benz_C11	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_C11	000	000
are
0.1
uF
.

This
introduces
another
large
low
frequency
roll-off
within
the
feedback
loop
.

Since
the
amplifier
actually
amplifies
the
difference
between
input
and
feedback
,
and
since
the
feedback
is
the
difference
between
input
and
feedback
,
and
since
the
feedback
is
taken
off
the
output
of
the
amplifier
,
at
low
frequencies
the
difference
signal
becomes
very
large
partially
due
to
the
roll-off
caused
by
the
0.1
uF
coupling
capacitors
.

Now
remember
that
we
have
shown
that
any
circuit
becomes
less
linear
with
increasing
amplitude
and
at
the
frequency
extremes
.

The
roll-off
caused
by
the
small
value
interstage
coupler
makes
the
front
end
work
very
hard
to
generate
a
large
low
frequency
correction
signal
.

This
causes
the
front
end
to
run
in
a
very
nonlinear
mode
at
low
frequencies
.

You
hear
it
as
"
muddy
bass
.
"

The
"
cure
"
is
quite
simple
,
make
the
interstage
capacitor
large
enough
in
value
so
that
the
loop
roll-off
is
minimized
,
thus
reducing
the
correction
required
,
and
letting
the
front
end
run
in
a
more
linear
mode
.

The
low
frequency
correction
signal
is
easy
to
see
on
an
oscilloscope
.

Using
a
low
frequency
square
wave
as
a
source
(
20
Hz
is
fine
)
look
at
the
signal
on
the
output
side
of
the
interstage
coupler
.

Note
that
it
looks
much
like
the
input
signal
.

Now
look
at
the
signal
on
the
input
side
of
the
coupler
.

You
will
find
the
circuit
is
generating
a
signal
with
a
large
bass
boost
!

(
This
is
true
in
most
tube
preamps
too
!
)

What
is
happening
is
that
the
"
flat
"
input
signal
is
rolled
off
by
the
interstage
coupling
capacitor
.

Then
the
rolled
off
signal
is
fed
back
to
the
input
and
a
correction
signal
is
generated
with
a
large
bass
boost
to
make
up
for
the
roll-off
.

The
boosted
signal
is
then
rolled
off
again
by
the
coupling
capacitor
and
its
output
looks
just
fine
.

But
the
"
monkey
motion
"
has
ruined
the
voltage
amplifier
's
linearity
at
low
frequencies
.

Now
let
's
look
at
what
is
wrong
with
the
original
Dyna
St-70
in
detail
.

Refer
to
the
audio
channel
schematic
again
,
keeping
in
mind
that
the
"
dashed
"
section
is
our
addition
,
the
original
has
the
input
connected
to
V2	B	V2	Visual_cortex	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex	000	000
directly
with
a
piece
of
wire
.

What
we
have
is
a
typical
vacuum
tube
amplifier
with
unlimited
bandwidth
input
acceptance
(
DC
coupled
)
but
with
limited
bandwidth
output
transformers
and
small
interstage
coupling
capacitors
.

The
power
supply
is
also
limited
bandwidth
,
being
pretty
feeble
at
both
low
and
high
frequencies
.

A
very
low
frequency
signal
is
rolled
off
by
the
interstage
coupling
capacitors
,
turned
into
a
"
lump
"
as
the
output
transformer
core
saturates
,
and
is
further
distorted
as
the
power
supply
runs
out
of
steam
.

The
feedback
signal
,
being
taken
off
after
all
the
disasters
occur
is
very
different
from
the
input
signal
.

This
generates
an
enormous
"
difference
"
signal
which
drives
the
front
end
into
100
%
distortion
trying
to
make
an
impossible
correction
.

Inasmuch
as
the
circuits
are
underdamped
too
,
the
"
blob
"
makes
the
amp
ring
for
a
few
cycles
attempting
to
digest
the
mess
.

Some
people
call
these
distortions
and
ringing
,
which
extends
up
into
the
mid-range
,
"
concert
hall
sound
.
"

Sorry
,
it
is
n't
concert
hall
sound
,
it
is
distortion
.

If
you
like
it
you
have
bad
taste
.

At
high
frequencies
the
compensation
in
the
voltage
amplifier
rolls
off
the
signal
,
the
active
devices
roll
it
off
further
,
and
the
output
transformers
attenuate
the
highs
further
yet
.

This
generates
another
huge
correction
signal
at
high
frequencies
,
again
more
than
the
headroom
of
the
front
end
,
clipping
the
correction
signal
once
again
.

Of
course
the
high
impedance
of
the
supply
has
further
compounded
the
problems
.

The
amp
is
driven
into
hard
slew
limiting
and
all
signal
entering
the
amp
while
any
internal
device
is
slewing
is
erased
.

Gobs
of
high
frequency
distortion
are
added
and
part
of
the
music
is
forever
lost
.

It
is
very
strange
to
think
that
some
people
use
the
St	B	St	STMicroelectronics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STMicroelectronics	000	000
-70
to
drive
tweeters
when
it
does
n't
"
tweet
"
at
all-it
does
kind
of
"
squeak
.
"

Obviously
the
power
supply
of
the
St-70
must
be
much
improved
.

NO
!

Not
necessarily
!

Think
a
minute
.

Consider
that
the
power
bandwidth
of
the
power
supply
must
be
greater
than
the
bandwidth
of
the
audio
circuit
.

There
are
two
ways
to
get
this
ratio
in
proper
order
.

The
expensive
(
and
stupid
)
way
is
to
build
a
huge
power
supply-and
if
the
amp
has
DC
coupled
inputs
you
can
never
make
it
big
enough
.

The
easy
and
smart
way
is
to
limit
the
bandwidth
of
the
circuit
to
within
the
capabilities
of
the
existing
power
supply
,
especially
if
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
bandwidth
limit
the
inputs
anyway
to
make
the
input
bandwidth
within
the
capabilities
of
the
output
transformers
.

As
mentioned
earlier
,
the
interstage
coupling
capacitors
,
C10	B	C10	Chevrolet_C/K	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_C/K	000	000
and
C11	B	C11	Mercedes-Benz_C11	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_C11	000	000
are
too
small
.

Note
that
as
long
as
the
input
is
DC
coupled
,
it
is
not
possible
to
make
C10	B	C10	Chevrolet_C/K	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_C/K	000	000
and
C11	B	C11	Mercedes-Benz_C11	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_C11	000	000
big
enough
,
as
even
a
very
large
capacitor
will
have
an
inside
the
loop
roll
off
when
compared
to
DC	B	DC	Direct_current	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current	000	000
input
acceptance
.

To
install
the
input
bandwidth
limited
filter
on
the
St	B	St	STMicroelectronics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STMicroelectronics	000	000
-70
you
will
need
8
parts
:
(
2
)
10,000
resistors
,
(
2
)
470,000
resistors
(
5
%
carbon
film
1/4
watt
parts
from
Radio	B	Radio Shack	RadioShack	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack	000	000
Shack	I	Radio Shack	RadioShack	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack	000	000
are
just
fine
,
and
it
would
be
better
if
you
could
use
a
meter
and
"
pair
"
them
,
so
they
are
matched
within
1
%
.
)

You
will
also
need
(
2
)
1000
pF
capacitors
(
mica
,
polystyrene
,
or
mylar
are
O.K.
,
of
about
100
volt
rating
-
the
capacitors
used
should
be
physically
small
)
and
(
2
)
0.02
uF
capacitors
(
film
)
100
volt
rating
,
again
physically
as
small
as
possible
.

Again
,
Radio	B	Radio Shack	RadioShack	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack	000	000
Shack	I	Radio Shack	RadioShack	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack	000	000
will
have
adequate
parts
and
if
you
can
match
them
on
a
precision
capacitance
meter
it
will
be
helpful
.

The
capacitor
values
suggested
are
not
absolute
.

Anything
from
about
0.02
to
0.033
uF
is
O.K.
for
the
larger
cap
,
and
800
to
1200
pF
for
the
smaller
capacitor
.

The
new
6
dB
per
octave
low
pass
and
high
pass
filter
is
installed
on
the
input
jacks
on
the
bottom
inside
of
the
chassis
.

We
suggest
that
the
mono-stereo
switch
wiring
be
eliminated
as
the
performance
is
poorer
when
bridged
mono
because
of
the
difference
between
the
two
channels
(
no
two
output
tubes
or
output
transformers
are
identical
)
.

If
you
decide
to
eliminate
the
mono-stereo
switch
,
then
do
the
following
:
1
.

Remove
all
the
wires
from
the
input
jack
and
mono-stereo
switch
except
for
the
two
wires
going
directly
from
the
input
jack
ground
lugs
to
the
PC
card
(
these
are
actually
extensions
of
the
leads
of
two
10
resistors
mounted
on
the
card
)
.

These
remain
.

Also
remove
the
two
original
470,000
resistors
from
the
jack
and
switch
.

2
.

Remove
the
two
wires
running
from
the
hot
lugs
of
the
input
jack
to
eyelets
7
and
17
on
the
PC
card
.

3
.

Connect
a
10,000
resistor
in
series
with
a
0.02
uF
capacitor
and
connect
the
capacitor
end
of
the
series
set
to
the
left
channel
hot
input
jack
and
the
resistor
end
to
eyelet
7
on
the
PC
card
.

4
.

Connect
another
10,000
resistor
in
series
with
a
0.02
uF
capacitor
and
connect
the
capacitor
end
to
the
right
channel
hot
input
jack
and
the
resistor
end
to
eyelet
17
on
the
PC
card
.

5
.

Connect
a
1000
pF
capacitor
in
parallel
with
a
470,000
resistor
and
install
the
resistor
between
the
left
channel
ground
lug
and
eyelet
7
on
the
PC
card
.

6
.

Connect
another
1000
pF
capacitor
in
parallel
with
a
470,000
resistor
and
connect
the
resistor
from
the
right
channel
ground
lug
on
the
input
jack
to
eyelet
17
on
the
PC
card
.

If
you
must
keep
the
mono-stereo
switch
option
,
do
the
following
instead
of
the
last
set
of
instructions
:
1
.

Remove
the
two
wires
running
from
the
left
and
right
channel
hot
lugs
on
the
input
jacks
to
eyelets
7
and
17
on
the
PC
card
.

2
.

Connect
a
10,000
resistor
in
series
with
a
0.02
uF
capacitor
and
connect
the
capacitor
end
to
the
left
channel
hot
input
lug
and
the
resistor
end
to
eyelet
7
on
the
PC
card
.

3
.

Connect
another
10,000
resistor
in
series
with
a
0.02
uF
capacitor
and
connect
the
capacitor
end
to
the
right
channel
hot
input
lug
and
the
resistor
end
to
eyelet
17
on
the
PC
card
.

4
.

Install
a
1000
pF
capacitor
in
parallel
with
each
of
the
two
existing
470,000
resistors
on
the
input
jack
and
mono-stereo
switch
.

For
mono
operation
,
the
amp
is
switched
to
mono
,
only
one
input
jack
is
used
(
either
left
or
right
,
but
not
both
)
.

Connect
a
jumper
wire
from
the
left
output
ground
to
the
right
output
ground
terminal
.

Connect
a
jumper
wire
from
the
left
16
tap
to
the
right
16
tap
(
for
8
speakers
)
.

Take
the
output
from
the
same
channel
that
you
have
the
input
jack
connected
to
,
using
the
16
and
ground
terminals
(
for
8
speakers
)
.

To
use
4
speakers
connect
the
jumper
from
the
left
8
output
tap
to
the
right
8
output
jack
and
connect
the
load
from
ground
to
8
on
the
channel
used
.

This
arrangement
parallels
the
two
channels
for
somewhat
higher
power
,
but
lower
definition
performance
.

Now
that
the
input
bandwidth
is
set
to
a
rational
,
finite
limit
,
it
is
possible
to
make
the
interstage
coupling
capacitors
"
big
enough
.
"

You
will
need
to
acquire
four
1
uF
at
400
volt
film
capacitors
(
mylar
,
polypropylene
,
or
whatever
)
.

Again
Radio	B	Radio Shack	RadioShack	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack	000	000
Shack	I	Radio Shack	RadioShack	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack	000	000
will
have
adequate
parts
.

Locate
and
remove
the
four
large
identical
black
tubular
0.1
uF
at
400
volt
capacitors
from
the
PC
card
.

They
are
positioned
parallel
with
the
front
of
the
chassis
,
one
at
each
corner
of
the
PC
card
.

Replace
each
with
a
1.0
uF
at
400
volt
capacitor
.

The
exact
value
of
the
replacements
is
not
critical
.

They
can
be
anything
between
0.8
uF
to
2.0
uF
at
400
volts
or
higher
.

It
is
important
that
all
four
new
capacitors
be
exactly
the
same
.

Further
detail
improvements
can
be
made
to
the
St	B	St	STMicroelectronics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STMicroelectronics	000	000
-70
.

The
bias
supply
capacitors
in
old
St	B	St	STMicroelectronics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STMicroelectronics	000	000
-70
amps
should
be
replaced
.

We
suggest
that
the
two
original
50
uF
capacitors
(
C3	B	C3	C_(musical_note)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(musical_note)	000	000
and
C4
,
located
on
the
7
lug
terminal
strip
under
the
chassis
)
be
replaced
with
new
100
uF
at
80
volt
electrolytic
capacitors
(
again
,
available
at
Radio	B	Radio Shack	RadioShack	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack	000	000
Shack	I	Radio Shack	RadioShack	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioShack	000	000
)
.

Note
that
the
positive
end
of
each
cap
is
connected
to
ground
.

Do
not
use
a
larger
capacitor
in
this
application
or
the
supply
will
come
up
too
slowly
,
over-biasing
the
output
tubes
at
turn
on
.

Although
the
original
power
supply
is
now
adequate
,
further
reductions
in
hum
and
noise
can
be
made
by
installing
an
additional
100
uF
at
500
volt
electrolytic
capacitor
(
a
450
volt
rated
cap
with
a
500
+
volt
surge
rating
is
adequate
unless
you
have
high
line
voltage
)
from
pin
8
of
the
power
supply
tube
(
V1-5AR4
)
to
chassis
ground
at
the
ground
lug
near
the
quad
filter
.

The
positive
end
of
the
cap
goes
to
the
tube
socket
,
the
negative
end
to
ground
.

Inasmuch
as
the
perceived
"
image
"
and
"
depth
"
of
an
audio
system
is
dependent
upon
both
channels
having
exactly
the
same
gain
and
phase
response
,
and
because
the
resistors
in
the
St-70
(
and
other
tube
amps
)
may
have
drifted
out
of
specification
over
the
years
,
it
is
helpful
to
replace
all
of
the
resistors
with
new
tight
tolerance
parts
.

The
gain
determining
resistors
especially
should
be
matched
to
each
other
within
1
%
.

The
RN60D
and
RL42S
metal
film
resistors
shown
on
the
attached
St-70
parts
list
are
a
good
choice
.

However
using
1/2
watt
carbon
film
resistors
for
the
RN60s
and
2
watt
carbon
film
resistors
for
the
RL42S
types
is
just
fine
,
except
you
will
have
to
sort
more
of
them
to
get
a
tight
channel-to-channel
match
.

Because
selenium
rectifiers
(
the
small
little
finned
block
located
in
the
bottom
middle
of
the
chassis
)
become
resistive
with
age
,
you
may
be
able
to
increase
the
voltage
to
your
bias
supply
by
substituting
a
lN4004
silicon
diode
for
this
part
(
Dl	B	Dl	Disabled_list	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disabled_list	000	000
)
.

Because
the
negative
voltage
to
the
bias
supply
will
now
be
higher
than
stock
,
it
probably
will
also
be
necessary
to
change
the
value
of
Rl	B	Rl	RL_circuit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RL_circuit	000	000
(
10,000
2
watt
resistor
)
to
18,000
2
watt
to
allow
the
amp
to
bias
adjust
at
1.56
volts
DC	B	DC	Direct_current	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current	000	000
across

in
the

of

and
P2	B	P2	P2_(AirTrain_Newark_station)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P2_(AirTrain_Newark_station)	000	000
.

The
St-70
and
other
tube
amplifiers
run
very
hot
.

This
tends
to
make
solder
joints
deteriorate
with
time
.

Re-solder
all
solder
connections
in
the
amplifier
,
including
all
parts
,
leads
,
and
the
tube
sockets
on
the
PC
card
.

Clean
the
input
jacks
,
output
terminals
,
the
bias
pots
,
and

the
noise
characteristics
,
gain
,
power
,
and
slew
rate
are
dependent
upon
having
high
quality
tubes
in
the
unit
.

We
have
SovtEC

$
6

and
a

.

We
do
not
have
7199
tubes
available
.

Refer
to
the
attached
schematic
and
parts
list
for
other
service
and
adjustment
notes
on
the
St-70
.

I
assume
you
have
noticed
we
have
not
spent
much
time
on
the
inner
details
of
the
circuit
topography
of
the
St-70
.

There
may
,
or
may
not
be
"
better
"
input
,
phase
inverter
,
and
output
circuits
available
.

The
point
is
that
almost
all
tube
amps
are
mistakenly
DC
coupled
and
whatever
the
internal
circuits
are
,
they
are
driven
into
gross
nonlinearities
.

The
important
concept
is
that
any
tube
amp
in
which
the
input
is
limited
to
within
the
internal
capabilities
of
the
circuit
will
outperform
any
tube
amp
that
can
be
driven
into
internal
overload
,
no
matter
how
expensive
or
complex
the
circuits
may
be
.

And
the
final
limitations
of
a
tube
amplifier
are
the
output
transformers
.

Lots
of
money
spent
trying
to
achieve
a
"
better
"
drive
circuit
probably
is
of
little
value
,
because
the
output
transformers
still
are
the
limits
of
performance
.

THINGS
YOU
SHOULD
NOT
DO
TO
YOUR
VACUUM
TUBE
AMPLIFIER
(
AND
WHY
)
.

DO
NOT
install
a
solid
state
diode
bridge
to
replace
the
vacuum
tube
rectifier
.

The
supply
is
operating
at
500
volts
with
line
surges
over
1000
volts
!

There
are
no
reliable
diodes
available
to
operate
at
this
voltage
.

You
will
be
in
great
danger
of
blowing
the
diode
bridge
and
damaging
your
power
transformer
and
filter
capacitor
.

In
addition
,
the
solid
state
supply
will
"
turn
on
"
instantly
,
and
the
full
B
+
voltage
will
be
fed
to
the
tubes
before
the
heaters
have
warmed
up
and
turned
the
tubes
on
.

This
will
tend
to
over
voltage
the
quad
filter
capacitor
and
capacitors
downstream
,
which
may
damage
them
.

The
output
tubes
will
run
hotter
than
normal
and
have
a
short
service
life
.

There
are
no
useful
redeeming
advantages
to
a
solid
state
diode
bridge
.

DO
NOT
install
solid
state
regulators
.

The
"
aftermarket
"
circuits
we
have
seen
use
transistors
with
inadequate
voltage
ratings
(
operating
in
the
"
blow-up
"
mode
)
and
have
severe
slew
rate
limitations
.

Remember
,
the
bandwidth
of
your
power
supply
must
be
greater
than
the
audio
circuits
,
and
a
series
bipolar
regulator
is
bog
slow
!

It
will
change
the
sound
,
it
makes
it
much
worse
!

DO
NOT
add
external
power
capacitors
.

The
long
hookup
wires
will
have
lots
of
inductance
and
impair
the
high
frequency
performance
.

DO
NOT
rewire
the
amplifier
internally
with
"
magic
wire
.
"

The
chances
are
you
will
screw
up
the
lead
routings
,
add
longer
lead
runs
than
the
original
and
increase
stray
inductances
.

The
probabilities
of
internal
short
circuits
and
bad
connections
increase
as
the
wires
are
too
large
for
reliable
termination
.

DO
NOT
replace
your
capacitors
with
high
priced
and
physically
large
"
wonder
caps
.
"

The
larger
the
physical
size
of
a
given
value
capacitor
,
the
greater
its
inductance
will
be
,
and
the
more
trash
it
will
dump
into
the
circuit
.

Magic
"
wonder
caps
"
do
change
the
sound
,
they
make
it
worse
!

DO
NOT
use
polystyrene
capacitors
near
heat
generating
components
.

They
change
value
with
temperature
,
and
near
an
output
tube
they
may
even
melt
.

DO
NOT
ship
your
vacuum
tube
amplifier
to
us
to
fix
if
you
screw
it
up
unless
you

Output
tubes
do
n't
survive
shipping
,
tube
amps
are
heavy
and
expensive
to
ship
,
and
their
performance
is
limited
.

One
of
the
"
joys
"
of
owning
a
vacuum
tube
amplifier
is
learning
how
to
fix
it
yourself
.

If
you
do
n't
want
to
do
this
,
you
should
n't
own
a
vacuum
tube
amplifier
.

Notes
Examining
the
1.56
volt
biaset
test
point
on
the
St-70
can
tell
you
much
about
the
condition
of
the
amplifier
.

If
the
output
tubes
are
old
,
it
may
be
impossible
to
adjust
the
bias
pots
to
bring
the
voltage
up
high
enough
.

Replace
the
output
tubes
.

A
shorted
output
tube
may
cause
the
bias
reading
to
run
away
high
.

7199
tubes
are
best
selected
by
examining
the
output
of
the
amp
on
a
scope
.

A
low
gain
or
noisy
7199
will
show
excess
output
hum
and/or
not
make
full
power
.

Fuse	B	Fuse	Fuse_(explosives)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_(explosives)	000	000
blowing
can
be
caused
by
two
problems
.

A
hard
blow
soon
after
turn-on
indicates
a
power
supply
short
,
either
a
defective
5AR4
tube
or
a
shorted
quad
filter
cap
.

A
fuse
that
blows
soft
or
after
a
few
minutes
of
operation
indicates
a
problem
with
the
audio
circuits
-
probably
a
bad
6CA7	B	6CA7	EL34	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EL34	000	000
tube
.

Note
that
the
bias
setting
will
vary
with
AC	B	AC	Alternating_current	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current	000	000
line
voltage
so
the
value
is
n't
an
absolute
.

It
is
possible
to
swap
tubes
channel
to
channel
(
except
the
5AR4
)
one
at
a
time
to
locate
a
defective
tube
.

The
new
input
filter
circuit
provides
-3
dB
poles
at
16
Hz
and
17
KHz
which
keeps
the
audio
circuit
working
within
the
limits
of
the
output
transformers
.

It
is
much
more
important
to
install

than
to

all
of

SUMMARY

INTRODUCTION
:

The
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
's
system
of
company
law
and
corporate
governance
,
setting
out
the
legal
basis
on
which
companies
are
formed
and
run
,
is
a
vital
part
of
the
legal
framework
within
which
business
is
conducted
.

But
over
time
,
the
Companies
Acts
1985
and
1989
have
become
convoluted
and
unwieldy
to
understand
as
successive
amendments
were
made
and
changes
emanating
from
Europe	B	Europe	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
impacted
on
our
domestic
law
.

So
the
Companies	B	Companies Act 2006	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
Act	I	Companies Act 2006	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
2006	I	Companies Act 2006	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
is
a
consolidating
piece
of
legislation
which
will
codify
and
re-arrange
existing
regulation
into
a
more
readily
understandable
and
comprehensive
source
of
law
whilst
giving
effect
to
new
aspects
of
regulation
as
part
of
the
government
's
reform
agenda
.

In
broad
terms
,
the
Act	B	Act	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
is
designed
to
promote
shareholder
engagement
and
a
long-term
investment
culture
as
well
as
introduce
new
provisions
for
small
companies
,
for
example
,
making
it
easier
to
set
up
and
run
a
company
.

But
it
also
introduces
new
requirements
around
narrative
and
performance
reporting
for
all
but
the
smallest
of
companies
1
--
the
subject
of
this
review
.

Helpfully
,
in
addition
to
codifying
the
requirements
of
the
EU
Accounts
Modernisation
Directive
the
Act	B	Act	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
ends
much
of
the
uncertainty
following
the
withdrawal
of
the
‘
Operating
and
Financial
Review
'
(
OFR
)
which
was
abruptly
abandoned
by
the
government
in
November
2005
.

After
the
demise
of
the
OFR
,
the
government
has
re-affirmed
its
commitment
to
“
encouraging
meaningful
strategic
,
forward-looking
information
to
assist
shareholder
engagement
”
,
but
there
are
some
notable
differences
between
the
narrative
reporting
provisions
of
the
Act	B	Act	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
and
the
OFR
it
replaces
.

For
instance
,
although
auditors
will
continue
to
be
required
to
report
on
the
consistency
of
the
Directors
'
Report
with
the
annual
accounts
(
as
is
required
by
the
Accounts
Modernisation
Directive
)
there
will
not
be
any
additional
requirement
to
check
for
other
inconsistencies
.

Furthermore
,
all
companies
will
be
exempted
from
disclosing
in
the
Business
Review
information
which
is
seriously
prejudicial
to
the
company
's
interests
.

This
exemption
was
previously
only
provided
for
companies
that
had
to
produce
an
OFR
;
and
finally
,
there
will
be
no
statutory
reporting
standards
for
the
Business
Review
.

The
former
Accounting	B	Accounting Standards Board	Accounting_Standards_Board	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_Standards_Board	000	000
Standards	I	Accounting Standards Board	Accounting_Standards_Board	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_Standards_Board	000	000
Board	I	Accounting Standards Board	Accounting_Standards_Board	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_Standards_Board	000	000
(
ASB	B	ASB	Standardization	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization	000	000
)
Standard	B	Standard	Standardization	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization	000	000
(
RS1
)
has
been
relegated
to
the
status
of
a
statement
of
best
practice
.

So
,
for
example
,
the
Act	B	Act	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
is
much
less
prescriptive
than
RS1
about
the
information
to
be
disclosed
when
reporting
KPIs
.

One
important
change
that
may
have
gone
unnoticed
by
many
is
that
the
requirements
for
narrative
reporting
have
been
streamlined
so
that
the
obligations
for
quoted
companies
are
now
more
closely
aligned
to
those
for
unquoted
companies
.

The
effect
is
that
all
companies
(
other
than
small
companies
)
and
not
just
quoted
companies
,
will
need
to
produce
a
Business
Review
as
required
by
the
EU
Accounts
Modernisation
Directive
,
with
the
primary
purpose
of
helping
shareholders
to
assess
how
the
directors
have
performed
their
duty
to
“
promote
the
success
of
the
company
”
.

This
white
paper
reviews
the
main
provisions
of
the
Business
Review
and
explains
the
implications
for
performance
systems
and
processes
.

the

to
implement
the
EU
Accounts
Modernisation
Directive
.

So
in
practice
,
companies
must
continue
to
prepare
and
publish
a
directors
'
report
containing
a
business
review
for
all
financial
years
beginning
on
or
after

.

THE
DETAIL
OF
THE
BUSINESS
REVIEW

Unless
a
company
is
subject
to
the
small
companies
'
regime
,
the
directors
'
report
must
contain
a
Business
Review
.

The
purpose
of
the
Business
Review
is
to
inform
the
members
of
the
company
and
help
them
assess
how
the
directors
have
performed
their
duty
to
promote
the
success
of
the
company
(
section
173
)
.

s.
423
Contents
of
Business
review

Section
423
says
that
the
Business
Review
must
contain
--

(
a
)
a
fair
review
of
the
company
's
business
,
and

(
b
)
a
description
of
the
principal
risks
and
uncertainties
facing
the
company

It
is
also
required
to
be
a
balanced
and
comprehensive
analysis
of
--

(
a
)
the
development
and
performance
of
the
company
's
business
during
the
financial
year
,
and

(
b
)
the
position
of
the
company
's
business
at
the
end
of
that
year
,
consistent
with
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
business
.

In
the
case
of
a
quoted
company
the
Business
Review
must
,
to
the
extent
necessary
for
an
understanding
of
the
development
,
performance
or
position
of
the
company
's
business
,
include
--

(
a
)
the
main
trends
and
factors
likely
to
affect
the
future
development
,
performance
and
position
of
the
company
's
business
;
and

(
b
)
information
about
--

(
i
)
environmental
matters
(
including
the
impact
of
the
company
's
business
on
the
environment
)
,

(
ii
)
the
company
's
employees
,
and

(
iii
)
social
and
community
issues
,

including
information
about
any
policies
of
the
company
in
relation
to
those
matters
and
the
effectiveness
of
those
policies
.

If
the
review
does
not
contain
information
of
each
kind
mentioned
in
paragraph
(
b
)
(
i
)
,
(
ii
)
and
(
iii
)
,
it
must
state
which
of
those
kinds
of
information
it
does
not
contain
.

In
addition
,
the
review
must
,
to
the
extent
necessary
for
an
understanding
of
the
development
,
performance
or
position
of
the
company
's
business
,
include
--

(
a
)
analysis
using
financial
key
performance
indicators
,
and

(
b
)
where
appropriate
,
analysis
using
other
key
performance
indicators
,
including
information
relating
to
environmental
matters
and
employee
matters
.

[
“
Key
performance
indicators
”
means
factors
by
reference
to
which
the
development
,
performance
or
position
of
the
company
's
business
can
be
measured
effectively
.
]

Where
a
company
qualifies
as
small
or
medium-sized
it
does
not
have
to
produce
key
performance
indicators
in
so
far
as
they
relate
to
non
-
financial
information
.

(
The
precise
rules
governing
what
qualifies
as
a
medium
sized
company
are
contained
in
s474
but
in
general
,
a
company
is
medium
sized
if
it
meets
two
of
the
following
three
criteria
;
turnover
not
more
than
#
22.8
m
,
balance
sheet
total
not
more
than
#
11.4
m
and
number
of
employees
not
more
than
250
)
.

A
significant
change
is
that
the
Act	B	Act	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
gives
directors
a
safe
harbour
from
civil
liability
in
respect
of
statements
or
omissions
made
in
the
Business
Review
.

Liability
will
only
attach
to
directors
if
such
statements
are
untrue
or
misleading
and
are
made
in
bad
faith
or
recklessly
or
,
in
the
case
of
an
omission
,
there
is
dishonest
concealment
of
material
facts
.

THE
CHALLENGES
OF
THE
EBR

So
the
Business
Review
,
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
Enhanced
Business
Review
or
EBR
deals
principally
with
mid-sized
companies
,
large
companies
and
listed
entities
registered
in
the
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
.

However
it
is
worth
noting
that
countries
right
across
the
European	B	European Community	European_Economic_Community	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community	000	000
Community	I	European Community	European_Economic_Community	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community	000	000
will
be
seeking
to
embody
the
requirements
of
the
EU
Accounts
Modernisation
Directive
in
similar
domestic
legislation
.

At
first
sight
,
the
requirements
of
the
EBR
seem
fairly
innocuous
and
undemanding
.

Afterall
,
most
companies
should
be
able
to
produce
a
fair
review
of
the
company
's
business
,
and
its
trading
position
at
the
end
of
that
year
.

However
,
there
are
a
number
of
matters
of
emphasis
and
disclosure
that
need
to
be
considered
carefully
and
could
present
significant
systems
and
process
challenges
for
companies
that
are
ill-prepared
.

By
and
large
,
quoted
companies
should
be
in
better
shape
to
comply
with
the
new
legislation
because
the
now
defunct
OFR
acted
as
a
‘
dry
run
'
.

Although
the
last
minute
withdrawal
of
the
OFR
was
frustrating
for
some
,
its
likely
implementation
forced
listed
companies
to
launch
OFR
projects
to
plan
for
appropriate
systems
and
processes
to
be
put
in
place
.

But
an
unfortunate
side
effect
of
the
sudden
demise
of
the
OFR
is
that
the
ensuing
debate
masked
the
fact
that
all
companies
were
going
to
have
to
produce
a
Business
Review
and
as
such
,
many
non-listed
companies
are
poorly
prepared
.

Leading
up
to
the
new
millennium
,
many
organisations
lavished
spending
on
ERP	B	ERP	Enterprise_resource_planning	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning	000	000
and
other
transaction
systems
rather
than
management
information
systems
which
have
a
pivotal
role
to
play
in
support
of
narrative
reporting
.

As
a
result
,
management
information
processes
and
enabling
technologies
are
fractured
and
information
of
the
sort
envisaged
by
the
EBR
is
not
uniformly
easy
to
gather
.

Over
reliance
on
spreadsheets
,
coupled
with
separate
processes
and
systems
,
including
but
not
limited
to
,
statutory
and
management
reporting
,
strategy
setting
,
budgeting
,
forecasting
and
performance
measurement
means
that
data
is
duplicated
and
scattered
widely
throughout
most
organisations
.

As
a
result
many
companies
will
find
aspects
of
the
Act	B	Act	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
more
challenging
than
perhaps
legislators
anticipated
.

An
unhelpful
aspect
of
the
EBR
is
that
commentators
,
the
press
and
government
refer
to
it
as
‘
narrative
reporting
'
,
which
implies
that
it
is
a
vague
essay
about
performance
.

But
as
is
so
often
the
case
,
the
devil
is
in
the
detail
and
close
inspection
of
the
Act	B	Act	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
's
requirement
's
reveal
that
the
areas
covered
are
far
reaching
and
extend
into
novel
and
unfamiliar
territory
such
as
environmental
KPIs
and
forward
looking
statements
.

Furthermore
,
directors
need
to
be
mindful
that
there
are
penalties
for
reckless
statements
and
although
there
are
‘
safe
harbour
'
provisions
,
it
is
important
that
the
EBR
is
grounded
in
reliable
and
robust
systems
and
processes
so
that
directors
can
fulfil
their
obligations
to
report
and
,
just
as
importantly
,
demonstrate
that
they
have
acted
in
good
faith
.

The
main
challenges
for
companies
in
relation
to
performance
systems
and
processes
lie
in
the
;

•
need
to
satisfy
the
strategic
purpose
of
the
EBR

•
obligation

The
strategic
purpose
of
the
EBR

The
main
thrust
of
the
EBR
is
to
allow
the
‘
members
'
of
the
company
to
assess
whether
the
directors
have
been
successful
in
their
legal
duty
to
“
promote
the
success
of
the
company
”
--
in
essence
,
whether
the
company
has
satisfactorily
carried
out
its
strategy
.

“
Success
”
is
very
broadly
defined
and
,
amongst
other
matters
,
the
directors
must
have
regard
for
the
interests
of
the
company
's
employees
and
the
impact
of
the
company
's
operations
on
the
community
and
the
environment
.

The
EBR
must
be
“
balanced
and
comprehensive
”

A
balanced
and
comprehensive
review
suggests
that
underlying
management
information
systems
and
processes
should
be
capable
of
drawing
together
a
wide
range
of
information
,
gathered
from
multiple
sources
and
that
performance
monitoring
,
measurement
and
reporting
should
capture
good
and
bad
performance
i.e.
balanced
,
throughout
the
reporting
period
,
which
now
extends
into
the
future
(
see
below
)
.

Forward
looking
statements

The
need
for
forward
looking
statements
about
likely
performance
in
the
future
based
on
an
analysis
of
“
trends
and
factors
”
is
a
significant
departure
from
existing
company
law
which
merely
requires
a
review
of
historic
performance
.

It
will
certainly
require
investment
in
appropriate
planning
,
budgeting
and
forecasting
systems
.

Disclosure
of
KPIs

Most
companies
should
have
little
difficulty
preparing
financial
KPIs
though
management
will
need
to
judge
which
KPIs
to
disclose
and
ensure
that
they
are
consistently
measured
across
the
enterprise
,
since
an
EBR
has
to
be
produced
for
every
company
(
apart
from
small
companies
)
in
the
group
.

However
,
the
requirement
to
produce
non
-
financial
KPIs
,
such
as
environmental
or
employee
KPIs
could
be
more
stretching
because
of
the
need
to
decide
the
appropriate
measures
and
draw
on
wider
sources
of
information
.

THE
IMPACT
ON
APPLICATIONS
AND
PROCESSESS

Taking
these
matters
together
,
it
can
be
seen
that
the
EBR
draws
on
a
very
wide
set
of
interrelated
business
applications
and
processes
.

Collectively
,
these
related
processes
are
referred
to
as
“
Business	B	Business Performance Management	Business_performance_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_performance_management	000	000
Performance	I	Business Performance Management	Business_performance_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_performance_management	000	000
Management	I	Business Performance Management	Business_performance_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_performance_management	000	000
”
(
BPM	B	BPM	Business_performance_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_performance_management	000	000
)
.

BPM	B	BPM	Business_performance_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_performance_management	000	000
is
a
‘
closed
loop
'
process
that
commences
with
the
preparation
of
a
business
strategy
,
the
development
of
budgets
and
operational
plans
and
then
provides
the
means
by
which
actual
performance
against
plan
can
be
measured
,
monitored
and
reported
.

In
the
fullness
of
time
,
the
experience
and
insights
gained
from
an
analysis
of
performance
and
an
understanding
of
the
key
trends
and
factors
affecting
it
can
be
used
to
refine
the
strategy
before
the
cycle
starts
all
over
again
--
the
closed
loop
.

A
typical
performance
management
process

Whilst
the
theory
of
BPM	B	BPM	Business_performance_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_performance_management	000	000
is
well
articulated
in
many
organisations
,
there
are
often
significant
barriers
to
its
implementation
,
such
as
an
over-dependency
on
spreadsheets
,
the
lack
of
suitable
applications
,
enabling
technologies
and
processes
that
bind
them
together
.

Strategy
setting

Perhaps
the
most
under-served
part
of
the
BPM	B	BPM	Business_performance_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_performance_management	000	000
process
is
in
the
area
of
strategy
setting
and
development
.

Given
the
pivotal
role
of
strategy
development
for
the
conduct
of
the
whole
performance
management
cycle
it
is
perhaps
surprising
that
it
is
such
a
neglected
process
in
so
many
organisations
.

Yet
,
it
is
often
characterised
by
an
un-auditable
collection
of
standalone
spreadsheets
and
documents
which
are
not
conducive
to
a
strategically
aligned
organisation
.

The
absence
of
suitable
systems
and
process
support
in
this
vital
area
poses
significant
business
risk
to
boards
of
directors
seeking
to
demonstrate
that
they
have
“
promoted
the
success
of
the
company
”
.

Clearly
,
it
is
management
's
responsibility
to
develop
a
practical
and
realistic
strategy
for
the
organisation
.

However
,
technology
has
a
vital
role
to
play
in
ensuring
that
,
the
strategy
is
communicated
throughout
the
organisation
,
that
operational
plans
and
performance
measures
are
strategically
aligned
with
it
and
that
monitoring
systems
highlight
management
actions
that
need
to
be
taken
to
keep
the
strategy
on
course
.

Therefore
,
in
fulfilling
the
obligations
of
the
EBR
,
there
is
a
strong
requirement
for
software
tools
which
support
the
iterative
process
of
strategy
development
and
allow
the
outcome
to
be
documented
and
revisited
as
appropriate
.

Planning
,
budgeting
and
forecasting

Once
developed
,
it
is
crucial
that
performance
objectives
are
built
into
the
operational
plans
and
forecasts
of
the
organisation
.

The
forward
looking
orientation
of
the
EBR
makes
it
essential
that
boards
consider
the
effect
of
current
trends
and
factors
on
performance
in
the
future
.

In
order
to
meet
this
objective
organisations
require
a
budgeting
and
forecasting
application
that
allows
for
frequent
re-forecasting
and
can
improve
the
analysis
and
business
insights
that
can
be
obtained
from
the
process
.

Modern
web
based
planning
applications
encourage
collaboration
between
budget
holders
,
accelerate
the
re-forecasting
process
and
through
higher
levels
of
participation
can
improve
data
quality
and
the
frequency
of
re-forecasting
.

This
latter
point
is
important
as
the
EBR
requires
directors
to
report
in
a
“
balanced
and
comprehensive
”
way
throughout
the
period
.

The
more
frequently
that
organisations
can
re-forecast
,
the
more
likely
it
is
that
directors
are
acquainted
with
the
trends
and
factors
affecting
performance
.

Scorecarding
and
dash-boarding

However
,
if
directors
are
to
deliver
success
,
it
is
vital
that
the
strategy
is
communicated
and
understood
throughout
the
organisation
and
that
operational
objectives
and
performance
measures
,
which
guide
organisational
behaviour
,
are
strategically
aligned
.

This
is
where
scorecarding
and
dash-boarding
applications
come
into
play
.

They
are
designed
to
help
companies
articulate
their
strategy
using
KPIs
,
communicate
strategy
across
the
enterprise
and
link
it
to
operational
objectives
and
initiatives
.

Leveraging
this
technology
,
individual
and
departmental
goals
can
be
aligned
with
corporate
goals
and
objectives
thus
ensuring
accountability
for
delivering
results
throughout
the
organisation
.

Consolidation

The
EBR
requires
all
of
the
strands
of
performance
management
to
be
brought
together
in
a
way
that
permits
“
balanced
and
comprehensive
”
reporting
across
the
enterprise
for
all
periods
under
review
.

In
this
context
consolidation
applications
used
for
management
and
statutory
reporting
form
a
very
necessary
part
of
the
drive
to
capture
information
reliably
from
a
variety
of
underlying
data
sources
at
the
end
of
each
accounting
period
.

Given
the
broadly
based
requirements
of
the
EBR
and
in
particular
the
possible
need
to
report
more
widely
on
non-financial
matters
and
related
KPIs
,
consolidation
systems
become
even
more
central
to
the
solution
.

The
ability
to
easily
adapt
data
entry
forms
,
collect
statistical
or
memorandum
information
directly
from
the
underlying
transactions
systems
(
ERP	B	ERP	Enterprise_resource_planning	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning	000	000
)
and
develop
business
logic
as
appropriate
are
essential
to
responding
to
the
detail
of
the
EBR
.

Web
based
data
entry
bolstered
by
vendor
certified
adapters
that
allow
integration
with
third
party
transaction
systems
are
becoming
essential
features
for
modern
performance
management
systems
.

They
can
significantly
reduce
reporting
cycles
leaving
management
with
more
time
to
analyse
performance
and
take
remedial
action
as
necessary
.

Reporting

In
recent
years
the
advent
of
cost
effective
,
web
deployable
reporting
has
opened
up
performance
management
applications
to
a
much
larger
population
of
end
users
.

Increasingly
,
this
extended
population
has
grown
to
include
individuals
from
all
levels
of
an
organisation
and
most
functional
areas
.

Indeed
,
the
EBR
,
with
its
diverse
reporting
requirements
,
underlines
the
need
to
engage
with
more
individuals
from
across
different
functional
areas
in
the
organisation
.

With
environmental
,
employee
and
social
reporting
firmly
on
the
agenda
,
it
is
important
that
,
say
,
finance
directors
,
HR	B	HR	Human_resource_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_management	000	000
directors
,
Production
directors
and
Investor
Relations
professionals
are
bound
into
a
joined
up
process
and
equally
comfortable
with
reporting
from
the
performance
management
system
regardless
of
their
skills
and
background
.

So
it
is
crucial
too
,
that
a
performance
management
environment
permits
a
variety
of
analytical
tools
to
be
deployed
allowing
users
from
different
functional
areas
to
select
tools
for
the
creation
of
regular
production
reporting
,
ad-hoc
and
interactive
reports
according
to
their
personal
preferences
.

As
such
,
in
addition
to
‘
normal
'
reporting
,
a
performance
management
platform
should
ideally
provide
choices
around
,
dashboards
,
scorecards
,
dynamic
spreadsheets
and
portals
as
well
as
making
use
of
the
latest
techniques
in
alerting
,
customisable
displays
(
colour
coded
meters
,
gauges
and
dials
)
,
animated
pin-boards
and
“
traffic
lighting
”
to
highlight
under
or
over
performance
in
a
visually
striking
way
.

INTEGRATION
IS
KEY

The
performance
management
cycle
as
a
business
process
draws
on
numerous
specialised
applications
and
potentially
hundreds
of
underlying
data
sources
to
provide
management
insights
.

Traditional
ETL	B	ETL	Extract,_transform,_load	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load	000	000
(
Extract	B	Extract	Extract	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract	000	000
,
Transform
and
Load
)
tools
,
designed
for
bulk
data
transfers
with
no
specific
applications
in
mind
are
likely
to
prove
lacking
in
a
more
challenging
performance
management
environment
.

Newly
emerging
FDQM
(
Financial
Data
Quality
Management
)
solutions
created
for
complex
performance
management
applications
where
interfaces
are
intricate
and
precision
is
vital
will
be
more
suitable
.

Specially
designed
to
leverage
the
skills
of
the
finance
community
to
maintain
financially
oriented
interfaces
,
they
provide
a
bridge
between
source
and
target
applications
in
a
similar
way
to
ETL	B	ETL	Extract,_transform,_load	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load	000	000
but
crucially
provide
visibility
into
the
processes
on
either
side
,
with
full
traceability
of
transactions
backwards
or
forwards
through
the
interfaces
.

Once
the
data
is
captured
from
the
source
systems
it
is
vital
that
performance
management
processes
,
applications
and
data
are
fully
integrated
so
that
the
integrity
of
data
is
assured
right
across
the
performance
management
environment
and
that
all
users
share
the
same
information
.

It
is
metadata
that
defines
structural
information
,
such
as
organisational
hierarchies
,
account
codes
,
time
periods
and
product
group
dimensions
that
form
the
backbone
of
most
performance
management
applications
.

Differences
in
metadata
prevent
reporting
across
applications
and
whilst
it
can
be
temporarily
forced
into
alignment
with
clever
mapping
tools
and
technology
it
quickly
slips
out
of
alignment
as
changes
are
made
to
different
business
areas
and
applications
.

In
theses
circumstances
,
MDM	B	MDM	Master_data_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data_management	000	000
(
Master	B	Master Data Management	Master_data_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data_management	000	000
Data	I	Master Data Management	Master_data_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data_management	000	000
Management	I	Master Data Management	Master_data_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data_management	000	000
)
style
solutions
that
allows
master
data
and
data
definitions
to
be
staged
in
one
repository
so
that
the
interrelationships
between
applications
are
defined
and
their
metadata
is
synchronised
throughout
the
performance
management
suite
are
crucial
.

MDM	B	MDM	Master_data_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_data_management	000	000
solutions
ensure
that
amendments
made
to
data
structures
by
end
users
in
any
application
are
automatically
reflected
elsewhere
so
that
any
of
the
other
applications
working
off
the
same
data
platform
are
automatically
made
‘
aware
'
of
the
change
.

Using
this
technique
,
structures
are
brought
automatically
into
alignment
,
reporting
maintains
its
integrity
and
consistency
of
reporting
is
assured
.

Unfortunately
,
many
organisations
have
grown
their
performance
applications
and
processes
in
isolation
,
often
using
different
software
vendor
's
tools
and
spreadsheets
which
accentuate
the
differences
.

In
these
circumstances
,
each
application
is
governed
by
its
own
business
rules
and
data
structures
rendering
comparisons
of
data
held
in
different
application
areas
unworkable
.

Making
sense
of
all
of
this
data
presents
significant
management
and
IT
challenges
,
particularly
as
the
reporting
landscape
is
constantly
changing
in
the
face
of
new
reporting
requirements
.

In
addition
a
possible
lack
of
consistency
in
reporting
seriously
jeopardises
the
reliability
of
reporting
.

In
the
context
of
the
EBR
,
independent
auditors
have
to
attest
that
the
claims
made
in
the
Business
Review
are
consistent
with
the
financial
statements
.

Therefore
,
both
management
and
auditors
need
certainty
that
,
for
example
,
a
financial
KPI
reported
in
the
EBR
,
such
as
Return
on
Capital
Employed
(
ROCE
)
is
completely
consistent
with
the
same
values
derived
from
a
scorecard
,
the
monthly
board
pack
and
the
current
forecast
.

So
integration
is
at
the
heart
of
performance
reporting
and
compliance
with
the
EBR
.

It
is
only
through
integrated
applications
that
management
can
be
sure
that
the
information
it
is
using
to
analyse
trends
and
factors
affecting
current
and
future
performance
is
reliable
and
comparable
over
time
.

SUMMARY

The
narrative
reporting
requirements
of
the
Companies	B	Companies Act 2006	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
Act	I	Companies Act 2006	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
2006	I	Companies Act 2006	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
are
part
of
a
growing
trend
in
company
reporting
towards
the
convergence
of
external
and
internal
management
reporting
combined
with
a
surge
of
interest
in
non-financial
reporting
,
most
notably
;
factors
that
affect
employees
,
the
environment
and
wider
community
.

In
effect
,
most
of
the
provisions
of
the
obsolete
OFR
have
been
re-introduced
in
the
Act	B	Act	Companies_Act_2006	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act_2006	000	000
and
apply
equally
to
quoted
and
unquoted
companies
.

The
breadth
of
disclosure
requirements
coupled
with
formidable
obligation
to
make
forward
looking
statements
means
that
management
has
to
have
its
‘
finger
on
the
pulse
'
of
the
company
continually
,
analysing
any
trends
and
factors
affecting
performance
right
across
the
enterprise
.

Such
demands
mean
that
it
is
no
longer
viable
for
businesses
to
manage
performance
in
functional
silos
or
to
use
a
series
of
unconnected
applications
and
processes
from
different
vendors
which
jeopardise
data
integrity
.

The
need
for
constant
appraisal
of
performance
coupled
the
speed
of
reporting
leaves
no
choice
but
for
companies
to
standardise
on
an
integrated
performance
management
platform
that
can
support
robust
and
dependable
processes
from
strategy
setting
right
through
to
performance
monitoring
,
analysis
and
reporting
.

But
the
needs
of
narrative
reporting
in
the
Business
Review
now
extend
beyond
the
pure
technical
requirement
to
unify
metadata
,
applications
and
technology
.

Potentially
,
the
construction
of
a
comprehensive
and
balanced
EBR
requires
the
involvement
of
different
functional
specialists
from
across
the
organisation
which
means
that
systems
have
to
address
a
wide
range
of
competencies
.

The
winners
in
performance
management
will
be
those
BPM	B	BPM	Business_performance_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_performance_management	000	000
vendors
that
can
provide
an
adaptable
and
rewarding
‘
user
experience
'
as
well
as
an
outstanding
technical
solution
.

Saving
historic
heart
of
our
townsBy
Donal
HickeyMonday
,
December
05
,
2011HIGH
streets
and
town
centres
throughout
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
have
come
to
look
the
same
in
recent
years
,
with
regular
department
stores
and
the
brash
brand
names
of
largely
overseas
multiples
increasingly
dominating
the
streetscape.The
result
is
that
many
cities
and
urban
areas
have
lost
their
individual
identities
.

Often
,
the
only
saving
grace
is
some
old
or
historical
building
that
stands
out
because
it
is
so
different
to
the
glass
,
steel
and
plastic
facades
of
today
.

The
venerable
landmarks
are
usually
officially
‘
listed
’
for
preservation
,
whilst
some
simply
escape
the
rush
to
modernisation
.

However
,
there
’s
evidence
that
places
which
are
retaining
their
historic
environments
are
doing
better
economically
.

We
’re
told
there
is
something
in
the
human
psyche
that
makes
people
enjoy
being
in
historic
environments
.

Sounds
like
a
no-brainer
,
though
obviously
not
to
many
commercial
developers
who
ran
riot
during
the
boom
years
.

But
,
just
think
for
a
moment
of
how
a
town
such
as
Clonakilty	B	Clonakilty	Clonakilty	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonakilty	000	000
,
in
west
Cork	B	Cork	Cork_(city)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)	000	000
,
can
make
the
most
of
its
built
heritage
,
or
why
Adare	B	Adare	Adare	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adare	000	000
,
Co	B	Co Limerick	County_Limerick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Limerick	000	000
Limerick	I	Co Limerick	County_Limerick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Limerick	000	000
,
always
seems
packed
with
tourists
and
coaches
.

The
prime
reason
surely
is
that
both
are
lovely
places
in
which
to
be
,
enhanced
by
a
deep
sense
of
tradition
and
atmosphere
.

The
east
Cork	B	Cork	Cork_(city)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cork_(city)	000	000
town
of
Youghal	B	Youghal	Youghal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youghal	000	000
,
famous
for
its
built
and
natural
heritage
,
sees
a
heritage-led
regeneration
plan
as
compensating
in
some
way
for
huge
losses
in
local
manufacturing
in
the
past
decade
.

Council	I	Youghal Town Council	Youghal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youghal	000	000
has
come
up
with
a
strategy
that
includes
conservation
of
the
landmark
Clock
Gate
,
work
estimated
to
generate
a
$
400,000
spin-off
for
local
business
each
year

also
being
offered

their
facades
in
a
historically-sensitive
way
.

Conservation
of
the
Youghal	B	Youghal	Youghal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youghal	000	000
’s
town
walls
is
also
a
key
part
of
the
plan
.

-
based

adviser
David
Geddes
tell
how
historic
environments
in
towns
and
cities
play
a
critical
role
in
nurturing
types
of
business
clusters
that
do
not
otherwise
normally
develop
.
"

It
is
important
that
those
responsible
for
planning
and
regeneration
in
every
town
and
city
across
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
have
a
good
understanding
of
its
historic
environments
in
their
town
and
city
and
a
plan
for
making
the
most
of
them
,
"
he
said
.

Mr
Geddes
has
conducted
extensive
research
in
Britain	B	Britain	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
into
the
economic
and
social
effects
that
historic
environments
have
in
towns
and
cities
and
has
been
working
on
the
implications
,
in
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
,
for
Limerick	B	Limerick	County_Limerick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Limerick	000	000
and
Waterford	B	Waterford	Waterford_GAA	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford_GAA	000	000
.

A
survey
of
35,000
people
living
across
Britain	B	Britain	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
found
that
cities
known
for
their
heritage
dominated
the
top
ratings
,
with
York	B	York	York	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York	000	000
emerging
as
the
most
enticing
English	B	English	England	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England	000	000
destination
outside
London	B	London	London	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London	000	000
,
and
Edinburgh	B	Edinburgh	Edinburgh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh	000	000
twice
as
popular
as
Glasgow	B	Glasgow	Glasgow	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow	000	000
.
"

There
is
a
direct
correlation
between
the
number
and
nature
of
heritage
assets
in
cities
and
towns
and
their
appeal
as
places
to
live
,
work
and
visit
,
"
Mr
Geddes
noted
.
"

It
is
not
just
a
case
of
people
liking
historic
environments
,
they
like
the
types
of
activity
that
takes
place
in
those
environments
.
"

The
research
showed
the
importance
of
creating
environments
where
people
enjoy
spending
leisure
time
.

Brighton	B	Brighton	Brighton	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton	000	000
is
cited
as
an
example
.
"

Making
the
most
of
historic
environments
is
the
only
known
way
of
overcoming
the
blandness
of
town
centres
that
people
so
often
complain
about
,
the
so-called
‘
clone
town
’
effect
where
every
town
centre
looks
alike
,
"
Mr
Geddes
remarked
.

Heritage
is
even
the
key
factor
in
the
success
of
world
famous
streets
like
London	B	London	London	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London	000	000
’s
Bond	B	Bond Street	Bond_Street_tube_station	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_Street_tube_station	000	000
Street	I	Bond Street	Bond_Street_tube_station	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_Street_tube_station	000	000
and
Regent	B	Regent Street	Regent_Street	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent_Street	000	000
Street	I	Regent Street	Regent_Street	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent_Street	000	000
,
he
stated
.

They
attract
top
rents
and
shops
that
are
not
found
elsewhere
because
modern
retailing
spaces
have
been
created
behind
historic
facades
.

That
gives
them
an
edge
over
nearby
Oxford	B	Oxford Street	Oxford_Street	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Street	000	000
Street	I	Oxford Street	Oxford_Street	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Street	000	000
.

Mr
Geddes
said
the
lessons
from
Britain	B	Britain	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
were
totally
applicable
to
towns
and
cities
across
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
.

The
long-term
prosperity
of
Limerick	B	Limerick	County_Limerick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Limerick	000	000
city
centre
,
for
example
,
is
entirely
reliant
on
making
more
of
its
great
historic
assets
.
"

It
should
be
aspiring
over
the
medium
to
long-term
to
make
O'Connell	B	O'Connell Street	O'Connell_Street	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connell_Street	000	000
Street	I	O'Connell Street	O'Connell_Street	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connell_Street	000	000
the
finest
in
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
,
to
use
the
castle
and
riverside
to
create
the
best
riverside
park
in
Europe	B	Europe	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
and
to
nurture
concentrations
of
interesting
small
businesses
in
the
historic
areas
on
the
edge
of
the
city
centre
.

It
is
lucky
to
have
the
assets
to
be
able
to
do
that
.

Now
,
it
is
a
question
of
making
the
most
of
them
.

Consider
How
to
Get
the
Best
Bang
for

Their
Bucks
in
Growing
the
Economy

By
Mary
Branham

The
good
news
is
this
:
The
Great	B	Great Recession	Great_Recession	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession	000	000
Recession	I	Great Recession	Great_Recession	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession	000	000
ended
in
June
2009
according
to
economists
.

But
there
’s
also
bad
news
:
At
this
point
in
every
previous
recession
,
more
new
jobs
would
have
been
created
,
economist
Zachary
Karabell
said
during
The
Council
of
State
Governments
’
Growth
and
Prosperity
Virtual
Summit
in
April
.

“
That
has
been
part
of
the
cyclical
nature
of
the
economy
,
”
Karabell
said
of
the
jobs
rebound
within
12
to
18
months
of
the
declared
end
of
a
recession
.

Some
two
years
later
,
that
has
n’t
been
the
case
.

The
jobs
have
changed
and
many
that
have
been
lost
wo
n’t
be
coming
back
,
Karabell
said
.

That
fact
has
put
the
onus
on
states
to
revamp
the
way
they
go
about
the
business
of
attracting
business
.

“
I
think
states
are
trying
to
think
more
intelligently
about
job
growth
and
the
pros
and
cons
of
how
you
approach
it
and
what
’s
necessary
to
compete
,
”

Rep.

Duffey	I	Mike Duffey	Mike_Duffey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Duffey	000	000
said
.

Duffey	B	Duffey	Mike_Duffey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Duffey	000	000
sponsored
legislation
this
session
to
do
just
that
in
the
Buckeye	B	Buckeye State	Ohio	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio	000	000
State	I	Buckeye State	Ohio	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio	000	000
.

That
legislation
replaced
the
state
Department
of
Development
with
JobsOhio
,
a
nonprofit
corporation
headed
by
business
leaders
appointed
by
the
governor
.

It
’s
a
public-private
approach
to
economic
development
that
many
states
are
taking
.

But
JobsOhio
comes
with
a
twist
--
development
director
Mark	B	Mark Kvamme	Mark_Kvamme	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kvamme	000	000
Kvamme	I	Mark Kvamme	Mark_Kvamme	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kvamme	000	000
is
a
venture
capitalist
and
is
bringing
that
perspective
to
Ohio	B	Ohio	Ohio	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio	000	000
’s
efforts
to
grow
jobs
.

Now
,
Duffey	B	Duffey	Mike_Duffey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Duffey	000	000
said
,
venture
capital
in
Ohio	B	Ohio	Ohio	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio	000	000
is
low
.

Kvamme
will
increase
efforts
to
attract
people
who
fund
entrepreneurs
.

“
Entrepreneurs
go
where
funding
is
and
we
want
them
to
be
in
Ohio	B	Ohio	Ohio	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio	000	000
,
”
Duffey	B	Duffey	Mike_Duffey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Duffey	000	000
said
.

“
We
want
them
to
grow
jobs
here
.
”

Incentivizing
Growth

Ohio	B	Ohio	Ohio	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio	000	000
is
also
looking
at
the
way
it
attracts
businesses
.

Kvamme	B	Kvamme	Mark_Kvamme	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kvamme	000	000
wants
to
move
to
a
model
where
the
state
is
investing
in
companies
rather
than
the
traditional
method
of
tax
cuts
and
land
deals
,
Duffey	B	Duffey	Mike_Duffey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Duffey	000	000
said
.

Venture
capitalists
do
n’t
just
give
money
away
,
and
Duffey	B	Duffey	Mike_Duffey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Duffey	000	000
would
like
to
see
JobsOhio
become
an
equity
owner
in
companies
that
locate
in
his
state
.

“
There
’s
increasingly
a
movement
toward
buying
rather
than
giving
,
”
he
said
.

“
That
will
not
only
keep
them
in
Ohio	B	Ohio	Ohio	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio	000	000
,
but
also
could
provide
some
return
on
the
value
,
long-term
,
for
the
state
.

You
’re
buying
something
;
you
’re
investing
in
the
state
.

You
’re
not
just
giving
away
money
for
promises
that
may
or
may
not
materialize
.
”

Many
states
already
have
some
method
--
through
the
clawback
provision
--
if
companies
do
n’t
meet
expected
job
growth

and
many

negotiate
for

pitting
states
against
each

in

process

“
Sometimes
incentives
make
sense
,
”
she
said
,
“
but
they
’ve
gotten
to
be
so
commonly
accepted
.
”

But
the
recent
recession
may
have
changed
that

the

rural
caucus
,
said
his
state
has
offered
both
cash
incentives
and
tax
credits
to
businesses
relocating
to
the
Bayou
State
.

He
expects
the
cash
incentives
will
dry
up
in
a
downed
economic
situation
.

Fannin
is
n’t
a
fan
of
such
incentives
.

“
I
hear
it
regularly
from
constituents
:
‘
Why
do
we
have
to
buy
businesses
?

’”
he
said
.

“
It
’s
a
drain
on
our
tax
dollars
that
I
think
is
viewed
somewhat
as
necessary
,
but
yet
people
do
n’t
seem
to
want
to
pay
for
it
when
they
have
to
choose
between
health
care
,
highways
or
education
...
It
’s
eating
away
at
our
tax
dollars
we
should
have
for
other
purposes
.

The
incentivized
investment
is
n’t
always
a
good
one
.

said
during
CSG
's
Growth
and
Prosperity
Virtual
Summit
that
companies
that
create
the
jobs
on
initial
location
do
n’t
always
stick
around
.

Feldman
agrees
.

“
Typically
,
companies
that
you
have
to
pay
a
lot
to
bring
into
a
state
are
going
to
be
the
first
ones
that
leave
,
the
first
ones
to
shut
down
and
move
out
of
town
,
”
she
said
.

“
Then
the
state
can
be
saddled
with
a
big
infrastructure
.
”

Fannin
said
those
costs
add
up
.

“
There
’s
no
question
if
we
could
actually
see
it
all
in
some
form
...
then
I
think
it
would
be
apparent
to
us
all
we
’re
probably
giving
away
much
more
than
we
’re
receiving
through
all
these
things
,
”
he
said
.

Stangler
said
states
should
look
to
existing
businesses
for
job
growth
.

“
You
do
n’t
’
start
with
1,000
employees
,
”
he
said
.

Existing
businesses
will
be
interested
in
different
incentives
than
those
a
state
is
recruiting
,
but
they
have
staying
power
.

But
you
also
have

Fielding	B	Fielding	Fielding_(cricket)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)	000	000
stats
are
a
combination
of
official
records
and
RetroSheet	B	RetroSheet	Retrosheet	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrosheet	000	000

.

Both
are
likely
to

Notes

Fielding
Data

Leagues
historically
made
no
effort
to
balance
team
,
league
,
and
player
fielding
stats
.

Since
1990
or
so
,
computers
have
made
this
feasible
,
but
prior
to
that
there
are
hundreds
or
thousands
of
discrepancies
each
year
in
games
played
(
even
whether
a
player
played
a
position
)
,
putouts
,
assists
,
double
plays
and
errors
.

Pre-1950
SB	B	SB	Stolen_base	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base	000	000
&
CS	B	CS	Credit_Suisse	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse	000	000
data
for
catchers
is
estimated
from
catcher
assists
,
games
started
and
opposition
stolen
bases
.

From
1950
on
SB	B	SB	Stolen_base	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base	000	000
,
CS	B	CS	Credit_Suisse	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse	000	000

,
&
WP	B	WP	Wild_pitch	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_pitch	000	000
data
for
catchers
and
pitchers
is
taken
from
play-by-play
accounts
in
the
retrosheet
files
.

There
are
several
hundred
games
without
pbp
from
1950
to
1973
and
for
those
we
may
not
have
any
data
.

CG	B	CG	Complete_game	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_game	000	000
&
GS	B	GS	Giant_slalom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_slalom	000	000
come
from
the
retrosheet
data
and
should
be
complete
and
pretty
accurate
from
1919
on
.

)
come
from
the
retrosheet

considered

complete

will
“
most

tournament	I	NCAA tournament	NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	000	000
hopes
of
a
team
once
flirting
with
the
top
10
--
or
a
second-straight
setback
minus
key
players
.

“
The
main
thing
right
now
for
our
guys
to
understand
is
the
importance
of
making
good
decisions
and
understanding
the
consequences
when
you
make
poor
decisions
and
then
moving
on
from
that
and
learning
from
that
,
”
Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
said
.

“
So
we
’re
dealing
with
that
.

It
’s
disappointing
and
unfortunate
that
we
have
to
deal
with
this
in
the
middle
of
the
season
.

“
It
is
what
it
is
,
so
right
now
as
a
team
we
have
to
focus
on
the
things
we
can
control
,
and
we
have
a
very
challenging
game
here
against
a
very
talented
opponent
in
Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
.

We
have
to
get
ready
to
play
the
game
.

,
Releford	B	Releford	Trevor_Releford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Releford	000	000
and
Steele
indefinitely
just
before
Saturday
’s
loss
at
LSU	B	LSU	LSU_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football	000	000
for
violating
team
rules
,
sending
them
packing
for
Tuscaloosa	B	Tuscaloosa	Tuscaloosa,_Alabama	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama	000	000
before
tipoff.That
was
also
the
second
game
of
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
’s
suspension.The
disciplinary

players
responsible
for
69
percent
of
its
scoring
,
57
percent
of

and
54
percent
of

at
a
time
when
the
stakes
are
ratcheted
up
.

Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
and
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
are
the
team
’s
top
scorers

rebounders
,
while
Releford	B	Releford	Trevor_Releford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Releford	000	000
leads
Alabama
in
assists
and
Steele
is
a
key
role
player
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
said
his
decision
to
hold
the
players
out
had
much
to
do
with
the
long-term
quality
of
the
program
and
trying
to
build
“
the
values
and
standards
that
you
want
your
team
to
represent
.
”

He
has
n’t
elaborated
on
the
reasons
for
the
suspensions
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
declined
to
say
if
the
violations
of
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
and
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
were
more
serious
,
but
reiterated
that
their
suspension
remained
indefinite
.

“
I
do
n’t
want
to
get
into
that
,
that
’s
just
the
way
it
is
right
now
,
”
he
said.This
is
the
third
time
Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
has
suspended
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
,
a
first-team
All
-
SEC	B	SEC	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
player
,
during
his
three
seasons
,
including
a
three-game
string
early
last
season
and
one
game
at
the
end
of
2009-10
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
did
n’t
rule
it
out
when
asked
if
he
had
a
“
three-strike
”
policy
that
might
keep
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
from
returning
.

“
I
’ll
make
some
decisions
on
that
later
,
”
he
said
.

“
Right
now
my
focus
is
on
getting
prepared
for
Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
.
”

Alabama
had
risen
to
No.
12
in
the
rankings
in
December
and
won
three
straight
before
the
LSU	B	LSU	LSU_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football	000	000
game.The
bold
decision
on
the
suspensions
was
no
surprise
to
Gators
coach
Billy	B	Billy Donovan	Billy_Donovan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan	000	000
Donovan	I	Billy Donovan	Billy_Donovan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan	000	000

Grant	I	Anthony Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
about
as
well
as
anybody
,
and
I
think
that
he
has
got
incredible
integrity
and
character
and
knows
exactly
the
way
he
wants
his
program
run
and
what
he
’s
going
to
do
,
”
Donovan	B	Donovan	Billy_Donovan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan	000	000
said.The
Tide
’s
eight
remaining
players
--
half
of
them
freshmen
--
managed
to
come
fairly
close
before
losing
67-58
to
LSU	B	LSU	LSU_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football	000	000
,
with
freshman
Rodney
Cooper
scoring
28
points
.

Alabama
had
beaten
Auburn	B	Auburn	Auburn_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_Tigers_football	000	000
by
18
points
without
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
.

Now
comes
a
much
bigger
challenge
,
even
with
Releford	B	Releford	Trevor_Releford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Releford	000	000
and
Steele.The
Gators
(
19-6
,
7-3
)
opened
last
March
with
a
78-51
rout
of
a
Tide
team
that
still
had
aspirations
of
winning
an
SEC	B	SEC	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
title
and
making
the
NCAA	B	NCAA	NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	000	000
field
.

Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
is
also
short-handed
,
but
because
of
injuries
.

The
Gators
wo
n’t
have
their
top
subs
,
forward
Will
Yeguete
(
concussion
)
and

Sir

Richard	I	Cliff Richard	Cliff_Richard	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Richard	000	000
played
the
role
of
chauffeur
over
the
weekend
when
he
drove
his
niece
to
her
wedding
in
Norwich	B	Norwich	Norwich	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich	000	000
in
the
back
of
his
luxury
Bentley	B	Bentley	Bentley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley	000	000
.

The
69-year-old
ensured
the
bride
,
Rachael
Harrison
,
got
to
the
church
on
time
by
getting
behind
the
wheel
of
the
maroon
coloured
Bentley	B	Bentley	Bentley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley	000	000
himself
and
personally
chauffeuring
her
to
the
ceremony
.

The
blushing
bride
is
related
to
the
singer
through
her
mother
,
Jacqui
Harrison
,
who
is
Cliff	B	Cliff	Cliff_Richard	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Richard	000	000
’s
sister
.

Despite
having
a
world
famous
performer
in
the
family
,
Cliff	B	Cliff	Cliff_Richard	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Richard	000	000
did
n’t
sing
during
the
wedding
service
or
the
reception
.

Cliff	B	Cliff	Cliff_Richard	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Richard	000	000

,
dressed
up
especially
for
the
occasion
in
a
purple
tinted
suit
and
shoes
to
match
the
Maroon	B	Maroon	Maroon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroon	000	000

car
,
and
completed
the
look
with
a
bight
fuchsia
flower
in
his
button
hole
.

According
to
reports
,
Sir
Cliff	B	Cliff	Cliff_Richard	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Richard	000	000
kept
a
low
profile
throughout
the
day
,
not
wanting
to
detract
for
his
niece
’s
special
day
.

However
the
long-standing
star
was
more
than
happy
to
pose
for
photographs
with
wedding
guests
,
and
for
the
official
wedding
snaps
from
the
day
.

.

Amos
Robinson
,
the
first
to
arrive
,
was
a
proprietor
of
the
town
chartered
in
1781
,
and
was
actually
the

original
proprietor
to
make

and
nearby
Williamstown	B	Williamstown	Williamstown,_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamstown,_Vermont	000	000
,
had
cleared
land
on
Northfield	B	Northfield	Northfield,_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northfield,_Vermont	000	000
's
Mill
Hill
.

He
built
a
grist
and
saw
mill
which
soon
became
the
center
of
business
and
social
activity
for
the
settlement
.

On
March
12
,
1794
,
the
first
town
meeting
was
held
at
Dr.
Nathaniel
Robinson
's
home
on
East
Hill
.

As
more
settlers
came
to
town
,
they
abandoned
the
hilltops
and
built
their
homes
westward
down
Mill
Hill
,
until
by
the
early
19th
century
,
a
small
hamlet
(
today
's
South
Village
)
had
grown
up
along
Sunny
Brook
and
the
Dog
River
.

The
village
,
known
as
Slab	B	Slab City	Randolph,_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph,_Vermont	000	000
City	I	Slab City	Randolph,_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph,_Vermont	000	000
because
of
the
saw
mills
established
there
,
also
contained
potash
and
grist
mills
.

through

.

By
the
1840s
the
settlement
had
crept
northward
from
South
Village
to
land
along
the
Dog
River
,
known
then
and
now
as
the
Center
.

What
is
today
's
"
downtown
"
was
originally
a
heavily
forested
swampy
area
.

In
the

Paine	I	Elijah Paine	Elijah_Paine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Paine	000	000
acquired
this
land
,
cleared
it
,
built
a
dam
on
the
Dog
River
and
erected
a
woolen
mill
.

The
last
to
be
settled
was
the

north
of

Village	I	Factory Village	Mill_town	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_town	000	000
,
which
was
,
and
still
is
,
a
small
closely
knit
settlement
.

In
1848
these
four
small
villages
began
to
flourish
,
thanks
to
their
leading
citizen
,
Charles	B	Charles Paine	Charles_Paine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Paine	000	000
Paine	I	Charles Paine	Charles_Paine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Paine	000	000

Like
his
father

,
Charles	B	Charles	Charles_Paine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Paine	000	000
was
well
educated
,
shrewd
and
personable
.

He
was
governor
of
Vermont	B	Vermont	Central_Vermont_Railway	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Vermont_Railway	000	000
from
1841
to
1843
,
and
in
1845
became
president
of
the
newly
chartered

Railroad	I	Vermont Central Railroad	Central_Vermont_Railway	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Vermont_Railway	000	000
.

He
built
the
headquarters
in
Northfield	B	Northfield	Northfield,_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northfield,_Vermont	000	000
,
much
to
the
disappointment
of
Barre	B	Barre	Barre_(town),_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barre_(town),_Vermont	000	000
and
Montpelier	B	Montpelier	Montpelier,_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpelier,_Vermont	000	000
.

In
its
extensive
yard
,
the
railroad
built
and
repaired
engines
and
cars
.

The
many
Irish	B	Irish	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
who
poured
into
town
to
work
on
the
railroad
became
permanent
residents
.

In
1853
the
Vermont	B	Vermont Central Railroad	Central_Vermont_Railway	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Vermont_Railway	000	000
Central	I	Vermont Central Railroad	Central_Vermont_Railway	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Vermont_Railway	000	000
Railroad	I	Vermont Central Railroad	Central_Vermont_Railway	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Vermont_Railway	000	000
went
into
bankruptcy
due
to
over
expansion
and
,
in
some
cases
,
mismanagement
,
and
bit
by
bit
hard
times
came
to
Northfield	B	Northfield	Northfield,_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northfield,_Vermont	000	000
.

The
railroad
,
placed
under
receivership
and
renamed
the
Central	B	Central Vermont Railroad	Central_Vermont_Railway	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Vermont_Railway	000	000
Vermont	I	Central Vermont Railroad	Central_Vermont_Railway	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Vermont_Railway	000	000
Railroad	I	Central Vermont Railroad	Central_Vermont_Railway	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Vermont_Railway	000	000

Albans	I	St. Albans	St._Albans_(LIRR_station)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Albans_(LIRR_station)	000	000
.

In
the
1870s
,
the
slate
industry
,
although
short-lived
,
eased
Northfield	B	Northfield	Northfield,_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northfield,_Vermont	000	000
's
economic
depression
.

Welsh	B	Welsh	Wales	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales	000	000
workmen
,
skilled
in
cutting
and
splitting
slate
,
arrived
in
town
and
contributed
to
its
development
.

The
granite
industry
,
particularly
under
the
business
acumen
of
five
Cross	B	Cross	Cross_(football)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_(football)	000	000
brothers
,
brought
new
life
to
the
town
in
the
1890s
and
early
1900s
.

Their
stone
sheds
,
plus
those
of
the
Ellis
Company
,
the
Pelaggi
Company
,
Phillips
&
Slack
Inc.
,
and
others
,
employed
hundreds
of
workers
,
many
of
them
newly
arrived
Italians	B	Italians	Italy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy	000	000
,
Spaniards	B	Spaniards	Spain	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain	000	000
and
Scots	B	Scots	Scotland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland	000	000
.

Gradually
the
Northfield	B	Northfield	Northfield,_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northfield,_Vermont	000	000
granite
industry
drifted
to
the
great
granite
center
in
nearby
Barre	B	Barre	Barre_(town),_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barre_(town),_Vermont	000	000
.

By
the
1950s
and
1960s
,
other
industry
rejuvenated
Northfield	B	Northfield	Northfield,_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northfield,_Vermont	000	000
.

The
old
Nantanna
Mill
under
Bernard
Goldfine
's
ownership
produced
fine
woolen
goods
.

The
Rabbit
hollow
Knitting
Mill
;
the
Wood
Products
Co.
;
the
Northfield
Telephone
Co.
and
its
later
outgrowth
,
Trans-Video
Cable
Television
;
Cetrangolo
's
granite
finishing
works
;
and
a
new
shopping
center
brought
much-needed
employment
.

The
largest
industry
in
town
is
unquestionably
Norwich	B	Norwich University	Norwich_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich_University	000	000
University	I	Norwich University	Norwich_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich_University	000	000
which
was
started
in
1869
and
remained
a
small
college
for
several
decades
.

This
venerable
military
university
employs
hundreds
of
people
,
adds
property
support
to
the
town
,
and
spends
millions
of
dollars
each
year
in
supplies
and
services
in
Central	B	Central Vermont	Central_Vermont_Railway	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Vermont_Railway	000	000
Vermont	I	Central Vermont	Central_Vermont_Railway	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Vermont_Railway	000	000
.

In
1950
,
Major
General
Ernest	B	Ernest Harmon	Ernest_N._Harmon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_N._Harmon	000	000
Harmon	I	Ernest Harmon	Ernest_N._Harmon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_N._Harmon	000	000
became
President
of
Norwich	B	Norwich	Norwich_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich_University	000	000
where
he
spent
fifteen
years
and
brought
enrollment
from
300
cadets
to
well
over
1,300
.

In
spite
of
many
changes
,
Northfield	B	Northfield	Northfield,_Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northfield,_Vermont	000	000
still
retains
many
characteristics
of
its
old-time
four
villages

the
South

;

On

the

expires
on
the

Already
harsh
words
are
being

exchanged
between
EU	B	EU	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
institutions
,
one
of
the
last
realms
of
diplomatic

kindness
.
"

The
violation
of
EU	B	EU	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
legislation
is
continuing
and
with
it
the

rights
of
European	B	European	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
citizens
are
being
violated
.
"

This
judgement
from
an

official
Working
Document
of
the
European	B	European Parliament	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
Parliament	I	European Parliament	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
is
aimed
at
the

Commission	B	Commission	European_Commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission	000	000
,
which
,
according
to
the
document
,
"
in
the
6
months
since
the

adoption
of

progress

with
regard
to
ensuring
that
EU	B	EU	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
data
protection
legislation
is
observed
"
.

Still
,
the
EP	B	EP	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
rapporteur
,
Dutch	B	Dutch	Netherlands	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands	000	000

continues
,
"

Your

commitments
do
not
offer

"
"

This
"
,
she
concludes
,
"
is
a
flagrant
violation
of
EU	B	EU	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
data

protection
legislation
,
as
laid
down
in

95/46
EC	B	EC	European_Commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission	000	000
and
Regulation

2299/89
.
"

Members
of
Parliament	B	Parliament	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
are
now
ready
to
prepare
two
oral

questions
for
the
Council
and
the
Commission
,
and
eventually
take
legal

action
before
the
European	B	European Court of Justice	European_Court_of_Justice	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice	000	000
Court	I	European Court of Justice	European_Court_of_Justice	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice	000	000

Justice	I	European Court of Justice	European_Court_of_Justice	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice	000	000
.

On
13
March
,
the
Parliament	B	Parliament	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
passed
a
resolution
containing
criticism
of

the
Commission	B	Commission	European_Commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission	000	000
's
secretive
negotiations
with
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
envoys
about
the

transfer
of
airline
passenger
's
personal
data
to
the
United	B	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
States	I	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
.

Parliament
was
angry
about
the
lack
of
adequate
level
of
data
protection
.

It
urged
the
Commission	B	Commission	European_Commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission	000	000
to
ensure
that
EU	B	EU	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
Privacy
and
Data	B	Data Protection	Information_privacy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy	000	000
Protection	I	Data Protection	Information_privacy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy	000	000
law

would
be
respected
.

Up
to
the
present
day
that
is
not
the
case
.

The

procedure
that
might
now
follow
is
laid
down
in
Article
232
of
the
EC	B	EC Treaty	Treaty_of_Rome	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome	000	000
Treaty	I	EC Treaty	Treaty_of_Rome	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Rome	000	000
.

First
an
official
warning
by
the
Parliament	B	Parliament	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
.

Next
,
action
before

the
Strasbourg	B	Strasbourg	Strasbourg	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strasbourg	000	000
court
that
could
result
in
the
Commission	B	Commission	European_Commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission	000	000
being
obliged
to

stop
the
transfer
immediately
.

Already
on
2
September
,
the
Chair
of
the
EP

Civil
Liberties
Committee
has
taken
first
steps
to
prepare
such
action
.

This
is
also
what
the
Parliament	B	Parliament	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
will
urge
now
:
a
prohibition
of
all
data

transfer
on
a
'
pull
'
basis
by
1
October
,
and
an
international
agreement

that
will
have
to
be
in
accordance
with
EU	B	EU	European_Parliament	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament	000	000
data
protection
law
.

In
her

Working
Paper
,
Mrs.
Boogerd-Quaak
goes
into
some
detail
and
exemplifies

minimum
requirements
any
future
arrangement
should
meet
to
avoid
legal

action
,
such
as
reducing
the
storage
time
from
7
years
to
the
duration
of

the
passenger
's
stay
in
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
and
reconsidering
whether
PNR	B	PNR	Passenger_name_record	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_name_record	000	000
transfer
is

adequate
in
the
proclaimed
fight
against
terrorism
.

On
5
May
EDRi	B	EDRi	European_Digital_Rights	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Digital_Rights	000	000
launched
a
campaign
against
the
PNR	B	PNR	Passenger_name_record	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passenger_name_record	000	000
transfer
,
with
letters

passengers

send
to
the
national

in

country
to
request
an
investigation
of
the
illegal

INTRODUCTION

Recently
,
some
new
processing

techniques
have
been
emerging
,
such
as
the
direct
application
of
physical

(
mechanical
)
fields
on
polymer
melts
.

The
route
can
be
realized
by
introducing

mechanical
or
ultrasonic
vibrations
.

Compared
with
low-intensity
vibration
,

ultrasonic
waves
are
widely
employed
to
influence
a
medium
through
shatter
,

cavitation
,
chemical
and
mechanical
action
,
with
low
noise
.

Lemelson
(
1
)

described
an
apparatus
and
method
for
controlling
the
internal
structure

of
plastics
in
a
mold
.

By
applying
ultrasonic
energy
to
the
solidifying

material
,
the
apparatus
can
control
well
the
crystalline
structure
formed

during
solidification
.

Pendleton	B	Pendleton	Pendleton,_Oregon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendleton,_Oregon	000	000
(
2
)
also
described
an
ultrasonic
process

to
modify
the
crystalline
structure
of
blown
polyolefin
films
.

Khamad

(
3
)
reported
that
imposition
of
ultrasound
on
HDPE	B	HDPE	High-density_polyethylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_polyethylene	000	000
melts
containing
a

small
amount
of
butyl
rubber
resulted
in
increase
of
cystallinity
,
reduction

of
structural
defects
,
and
enhancement
of
mechanical
properties
.

Isayev

and
Levin
(
4-7
)
introduced
ultrasonic
vibrations
to
an
extruder
by
which

they
accomplished
reclaiming
rubber
from
old
tires
and
found
improvements

of
some
mechanical
properties
of
the
extrudate
,
such
as
strain
at
break

and
Young
's
modulus
.

However
,
there
is
little
study
on
crystalline
structure

of
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
for
the
case
when
ultrasound
is
employed
at
the
die
entrance
.

This
article
studies
PP
extrusion

with
parallel
superposition
of
ultrasonic
waves
upon
the
die
.

The
effects

of
ultrasound
vibrations
during
extrusion
on
improving
processability

and
crystallization
of
PP
melts
are
described
.

consists
of
a

,
with

a

The
direction
of

coincides
with
that

Samples

all

which
are

very

RESULTS
AND
DISCUSSION

Die
Temperature

Figure
2
shows
a
prominently
exponential

ascendance
in
die
temperature
by
introducing
ultrasonic
vibration
during

extrusion
of
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
.

In
presence
of
250
W
ultrasonic
intensity
,
die
temperature

at
5
rpm
jumped
10
deg
C
higher
than
without
ultrasonic
vibration
.

This

is
because
part
of
the
sound
energy
is
converted
into
heat
energy
by
the

internal
friction
between
the
melt
molecules
.

For
a
given
shear
rate
,

the
temperature
rise
is
a
function
of
ultrasonic
intensity
.

The
higher

the
intensity
,
the
more
violent
the
molecular
motion
,
and
the
greater

the
temperature
rise
.

Die
Pressure
and
Throughput

The
dependence
of
die
pressure

on
ultrasonic
intensity
at
different
screw
speed
was
examined
.

Figure

3
shows
that
higher
ultrasonic
intensity
and
lower
rotation
speed
both

contribute
to
a
larger
reduction
of
pressure
,
indicating
that
the
pressure

drop
depends
on
the
intensity
and
duration
of
ultrasonic
treatment
.

An

increase
of
both
factors
gives
the
melt
the
chance
to
obtain
stronger

energy
from
ultrasound
.

In
addition
,
ultrasonic
vibration
during
extrusion

affects
the
throughput
of
extrudate
;
the
flow
rate
increases
with
an
increase

in
the
ultrasonic
wave
intensity
,
as
shown
in
Fig.
4
.

All
of
the
above-mentioned

characteristics
demonstrate
that
ultrasonic
treatment
will
significantly

improve
the
extrusion
efficiency
.

Apparent
Viscosity

The
prominent
pressure
drops
after

the
introduction
of
ultrasound
into
melts
are
surely
related
to
molecular

chain
structure
,
which
can
be
reflected
in
viscosity
data
.

5
shows

the
dependence
of
apparent
viscosity
on
ultrasonic
intensity
at
various

rotation
speeds
.

Ultrasonic
motions
result
in
a
sharp
decrease
of
viscosity

of
the
melt
.

Since
higher
screw
speed
means
shorter
residence
time
,
the

decrease
of
apparent
viscosity
of
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
is
also
a
function
of
ultrasonic

intensity
and
time
,
just
like
the
pressure
reduction
.

Further
,
Fig.

demonstrate
that
MFR	B	MFR	Manufacturing	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing	000	000
increases
after
application
of
ultrasound
under
the

same
extrusion
conditions
.

But
with
low
-
intensity
ultrasound
,
MFR	B	MFR	Manufacturing	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing	000	000
changes

very
little-from
4.2
g/10
min
(
OW
)
to
4.7
g
/
10
min
(
100
W
)
.

It
may
be

concluded
that
appropriate
ultrasonic
irradiation
can
accelerate
molecular

motion
and
make
long
entangled
macromolecular
chains
unravel
with
a
low

degree
of
degradation
.

Die
Swell

The
swelling
of
the
extrudate

in
capillary
extrusion
is
a
manifestation
of
the
elastic
properties
and

the
fading
memory
of
the
melt
,
and
is
a
result
of
unrelaxed
deformations

generated
during
the
extrusion
process
.

Figure
7
shows
that
die
swell

ratios
D
/
D	B	D	Defenceman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman	000	000
^
sub
0
^
decrease
with
increasing
ultrasonic
irradiation
power
.

Since
swelling
is
a
relaxation
process
,
energy
from
ultrasonic
irradiation

can
affect
the
relaxation
of
polymer
melts
by
shortening
the
relaxation

time
of
chain
segments
,
thus
decreasing
the
elasticity
of
the
melt
at

the
die
entrance
.

It
is
also
observed
that
ultrasonic
waves
contribute

to
a
smoother
appearance
of
extrudates
.

Crystalline
Structure

Ultrasound
can
greatly
improve

the
processing
of
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
,
and
this
effect
must
be
a
result
of
structural
changes

of
the
PP
chain
.

At
the
same
time
,
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
is
well
known
for
its
different

crystalline
forms
:
alpha
,
beta
and
gamma
forms
.

So
the
ultrasonic
irradiation

probably
induces
the
change
of
the
crystal
structure
.

To
verify
this
hypothesis
,

samples
were
analyzed
by
DSC	B	DSC	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
and
WAXD	B	WAXD	Wide-angle_X-ray_scattering	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-angle_X-ray_scattering	000	000
.

Table
1
summarizes
the
values
obtained

from
DSC	B	DSC	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
thermograms
.

T	B	T	T	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T	000	000
^
sub
c
^
is
the
crystallization
temperature
,
T
^
sub

^
is
the
temperature
at
the
cross
point
of
the
megathermic
tangent

line
and
the
base
line
at
angle
of
alpha
.

Si	B	Si	Silicon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon	000	000
,
the
tangent
of
alpha
,
is

a
measure
of
the
rate
of
nucleation
.

(
T
^
sub
onset
^
-
T
^
sub
c
^
)
is
a
measure

of
overall
rate
of
crystallization
of
the
system
,
which
decreases
with

the
increase
of
the
crystallization
rate
(
11
)
.

It
has
been
found
that

with
the
use
of
ultrasonic
vibration
,
(
T
^
sub
onset
^
--
T	B	T	T	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T	000	000
^
sub
c
^
)
,
Si	B	Si	Silicon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon	000	000
and

crystallinity
are
lower
than
their
respective
values
for
a
sample
without

ultrasonic
treatment
.

This
indicates
that
ultrasound
prevents
nucleation

as
well
as
accelerating
the
growth
of
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
crystal
,
and
the
decreased
rate

of
nucleation
may
lead
to
lower
crystallinity
.

Furthermore
,
it
is
also

noted
from
Fig.
8
that
in
the
case
of
ultrasound
,
the
peak
occurring
at

lower
temperature
,
which
corresponds
to
fusion
of
beta-form
(
temperature

of
the
peak
is
about
145
deg
C
)
,
becomes
stronger
and
the
enthalpy
is

higher
.

The
other
hightemperature
peak
due
to
fusion
of
the
alpha-form

is
correspondingly
weaker
.

These
investigations
may
imply
that
processing

PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
with
ultrasound
causes
a
preference
for
the
growth
of
the
beta-form

relative
to
that
of
the
alpha-form
.

Table
1
.

It
can
be
seen
from
the
X-ray

diffraction
patterns
that
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
samples
with
and
without
ultrasonic
treatment

are
different
(
Fig.
9
and
Table
2
)
.

By
introducing
ultrasonic
effects
,

peaks
at
theta
=
16
deg
,
21.3
deg
increase
and
become
markedly
wider
(
Mg
.

9
)
.

In
addition
,
Table
2
shows
the
values
of
the
increase
of
K
.

According

to
Turner-Jones
(
9
)
,
these
indicate
an
increase
of
the
beta-forms
of
polypropylene
.

Moreover
,
the
data
listed
in
Table
2
show
that
nearly
all
the
d
spacing

of
crystal
planes
of
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
decrease
and
values
of
S
increase
with
ultrasonic

treatment
.

The
maximum
contribution
(
K
=
29.5
%
)
and
maximum
order
(
S
=

47.9
%
)
of
the
beta
phase
are
in
the
samples
affected
by
ultrasonic
power

of
180
W.
All
the
above
imply
that
ultrasonic
vibrations
can
shorten
the

distances
between
molecular
chains
and
decrease
the
crystal
defects
and

disordered
structure
,
so
that
the
lattices
of
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
have
an
increased
order
.

The
enhancement
of
the
beta-form
combined
with
the
decrease
of
crystallinity

implies
that
the
polymorphic
transitions
alpha
-
>
beta
of
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
may
exist

in
the
system
.

CONCLUSION

The
application
of
ultrasound

to
extrusion
can
improve
the
processing
of
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
by
raising
the
die
temperature

and
decreasing
pressure
and
viscosity
,
thus
enhancing
the
throughput
and

appearance
of
extrudate
\
s
.

The
results
show
that
this
ultrasonic

process
can
modify
the
structure
of
crystallizable
thermoplastic
materials

like
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
during
extrusion
.

Ultrasonic
irradiation
results
in
a
reduction

of
the
crystallinity
of
extruded
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
.

Ultrasound
also
shows
a
selective

effect
on
the
growth
of
different
crystal
forms
of
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
,
which
causes
an

increase
of
the
relative
amount
and
order
of
the
beta-form
as
well
as

transitions
of
the
alpha-form
to
the
beta-form
.

Ebert	I	Roger Ebert	Roger_Ebert	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert	000	000
loved
it
.

I
am
presenting
you
with
all
this
information
because
this
movie
is
an
anomoly
.

It
is
a
religious
movie
that
is
making
it
big
due
to
its
hype
,
which
includes
the
strangeness
of
having
an
action
star
directing
a
movie
about
the
death
of
Christ	B	Christ	Christ	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ	000	000
and
accusations
of
anti-Semitism
.

Personally
,
I
do
n't
plan
on
seeing
it
in
the
theaters
.

From
what
I
've
heard
,
the
film
is
anti-Semetic
on
some
level
and
I
do
n't
want
to
contribute
to
that
.

As
people
I
know
start
to
see
it
,
I
may
change
my
mind
,
but
for
the
moment
I
do
n't
want
to
give
money
to
a
project
that
is
potentially
racist
.

Despite
my
personal
views
,
I
am
intrigued
by
the
film
's
potentially
huge
first-weekend
gross
.

On
the
one
hand
it
is
frustrating
that
a
religious
movie
,
which
I
would
n't
expect
to
have
mass
appeal
,
is
expected
to
do
so
well
and
open
so
wide
when
movies
that
I
think
are
amazing
get
overlooked
.

As
I
mentioned
earlier
,
it
sounds
like
this
movie
is
riding
on
its
hype
.

Think
about
it
logically
--
do
you
think
that
a
highly
controversial
religious
film
that
is
mostly
in
Latin	B	Latin	Latin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin	000	000
and
Aramaic	B	Aramaic	Aramaic_language	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_language	000	000
would
do
well
in
the
theaters
if
done
by
a
no-name
director
?

Of
course
not
,
but
that
discussion
will
be
saved
for
a
future
post
.

I
shall
leave
you
with
a
final
thought
on
the
violence
in
this
film
,
from
my
home-town
critic
,
Roger	B	Roger Ebert	Roger_Ebert	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert	000	000
Ebert	I	Roger Ebert	Roger_Ebert	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert	000	000
.

Note
:
I
said
the
film
is
the
most
violent
I
have
ever
seen
.

It
will
probably
be
the
most
violent
you
have
ever
seen
.

This
is
not
a
criticism
but
an
observation
;
the
film
is
unsuitable
for
younger
viewers
,
but
works
powerfully
for
those
who
can
endure
it
.

The
MPAA	B	MPAA	Motion_Picture_Association_of_America	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America	000	000
's
R
rating
is
definitive
proof
that
the
organization
either
will
never
give
the
NC-17
rating
for
violence
alone
,
or
was
intimidated
by
the
subject
matter
.

If
it
had
been
anyone
other
than
Jesus	B	Jesus	Jesus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus	000	000
up
on
that
cross
,
I
have
a
feeling
that
NC-17
would
have
been
automatic
.

The
NYT	B	NYT	The_New_York_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times	000	000
had
a
great
review
of
the
film
,
basically
saying
that
the
problem
with
the
film
is
not
its
bigotry
(
"
this
on-screen
villainy
does
not
seem
to
exceed
what
can
be
found
in
the
source
material
"
)
but
rather
the
excessive
violence
:
"

a
film
made
with
evident
and
abundant
religious
conviction
that
is
at
the
same
time
so
utterly
lacking
in
grace
.
"

Not
sure
as
of
yet
if
i
want
to
wait
for
this
one
to
go

The
priests
called
it
amazing
;
the
rabbis
called
it
abominable

anti-semetic

One

said
it
was
a

dangerous
"
film
,
while
a
born-again
christian
said
she
was
seeing
it
again
on
Saturday

As

i

there

«
and
more
progress
...
The
day
after
...
»

We
’re
making
progress
...
Sei
’s
just
very
careful
about
coming
onto
Herself
’s
territory
;
but
yesterday
he
spent
most
of
the
day
under
the
chest
of
drawers
in
my
room
...
rather
a
high
legged
chest
,
so
I
know
he
’s
there
,
and
he
can
watch
things
.

He
spent
last
night
there
,
too
,
or
at
least
was
there
this
morning
.

This
morning
I
called
to
him
,
and
he
came
over
,
very
cautiously
got
onto
the
bed
.

Then
started
head-butting
and
rolling
over
and
doing
tummy
fur
and
got
under
the
covers
and
purred
.

Did
n’t
stay
there
long
.

I
’ve
been
careful
not
to
force
him
to
do
anything
.

I
just
call
,
and
if
he
wants
to
come
,
he
comes
...
but
he
’s
getting
more
willing
to
pay
attention
.

[
Ysabel
would
come
when
I
called
,
infallibly
,
dear
old
girl
.
]

But
no
comparisons
are
fair
.

Sei
came
to
us
as
a
young
gentleman
,
a
year
old
,
and
he
’s
got
his
own
ways
,
which
are
very
fine
.

Patience
is
my
part
in
this
transaction
;
trust
,
in
his
.

So
we
have
at
least
the
beginning
of
a
partnership
.

No
,
I
’m
not
fickle
:
I
feel
Ysabel
’s
absence
deeply
,
but
I
will
do
that
for
a
long
,
long
time
.

But
Sei
’s
at
a
crossroads
,
and
I
ca
n’t
leave
him
there
:
I
have
to
open
the
way
for
him
to
be
him
,
and
not
ask
him
to
be
Ysabel
,
but
to
try
to
get
those
behaviors
that
are
safety
for
a
traveling
kitteh
,
the
willingness
to
be
close
to
me
,
and
to
pay
attention
to
my
voice
.

He
’s
caught
in
a
moment
of
change
,
and
wondering
what
happened
and
if
there
’s
now
a
room
in
the
house
that
could
be
his
,
and
he
’s
interested
;
I
have
to
meet
that
willingness
fairly
,
and
if
I
shed
a
tear
or
two
in
the
process
,
well
,
kittehs
do
n’t
understand
that
sort
of
thing
half
as
well
as
they
understand
an
offered
lap
and
a
cuddle
.

Sei
is
the
guide
for
the
next
part
of
your
journey
.

A
fire
ceremony
to
honour
Ysabel
might
be
beneficial
.

Honour
and
release
.

She
will
then
be
able
to
walk
by
your
side
from
the
energetic
side
of
the
fence
,
and
that
will
then
allow
Sei
to
step
into
his
role
on
this
side
.

He
may
need
to
know
that
the
“
space
”
is
open
for
him
to
step
into
.

Part
of
that
is
awareness
,
that
there
has
been
and
is
going
to
be
a
significant
transition
on
your
journey
,
and
inviting
Sei
to
lead
,
guide
and
protect
you
.

I
think
Ysabel
waited
until
she
was
sure
she
was
leaving
you
in
good
paws

I
think
horsewisevt
has
given
an
excellent
suggestion
.

When
you
feel
ready
,
you
and
Jane
can
arrange
a
ceremony
for
Shu
and
Sei
both
as
they
assume
new
roles
in
the
household
.

In
no
way
will
the
elder
cats
be
forgotten
,
but
the
younger
ones
can
be
promoted
,
so
to
speak
.

Please
let
me
know
when
you
feel
up
to
lighting
the
Shejidan
lantern
for
Ysabel
.

We
need
to
do
it
yet
for
Emily
and
Katie
.

Tears
will
be
shed
,
but
crying
never
hurt
anyone
,
and
is
healing
,
I
think
.

Seishi
seems
like
a
gentle
creature
that
was
not
loved
nearly
enough
in
his
past
life
,
and
he
is
surely
in
the
right
place
now
.

And
you
know
cats
always
know
when
you
are
hurting
and
they
want
to
come
help
you
feel
better
.

I
do
like
to
think
of
you
three
(
or
five
)
lighting

Even
in
the
greatest
sadness
a
cat
is
a
perfect
anchor
to
reality
,
and
a
cat
’s
fur
can
soak
up
any
amount
of
tears
.

Somehow
they
leave
space
for
our
memories
of
lost
ones
,
but
filling
gaps
we
never
knew
existed
with
new
quirks
.

I
have
been
away
from
the
computer
for
a
few
days
and
did
not
know
.

I
am
so
,
so
sorry
.

So
very
sorry
.

Ever
since
we
lost
our
Carrots	B	Carrots	Carrot	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot	000	000
kitty
,
our
newest
member
of
the
household
,
Jack	B	Jack Bauer	Jack_Bauer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bauer	000	000
Bauer	I	Jack Bauer	Jack_Bauer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bauer	000	000
,
has
tried
to
take
up
the
slack
.

He
is
a
big
kitty
,
with
big
paws
,
like
Seishi
,
and
so
very
soft
.

Whenever
any
of
us
is
especially
missing
our
Carrots
,
there
he
is
,
insisting
on
being
held
and
offering
comfort
,
just
like
Kokipy
says
.

And
yes
,
Sloren
is
right
...
a
cat
’s
fur
really
can
soak
up
any
amount
of
tears
.

I
’ll
be
keeping
you
in
my
thoughts
.

Something
that
might
brighten
your
day
a
bit
.

Today
,
went
to
the
store
and
they
’re
moving
everything
around
.

Looked
for
,
did
n’t
find
udon
noodles
this
time
.

Will
find
them
(
or
other
whole
wheat
/
buckwheat
)
next
time
.

But
what
I
*
did
*
find
by
accident
gave
me
a
chuckle
,
so
I
thought
I
’d
share
.

Looking
through
the
shelves
,
what
do
I
run
across
,
but
“
Pocky	B	Pocky	Pocky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocky	000	000
.
”

Now
,
I
did
n’t
know
what
“
Pocky	B	Pocky	Pocky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocky	000	000
”
is
,
except
a
reference
in
anime
and
art
and
fanfic
.

Huh
,
I
think
,
probably
sweeter
than
anything
,
but
(
haha
)
I
bought
a
package
to
try
.

Had
to
.

Thought
it
might
give
you
both
a
grin
.

My
daughter
,
who
loves
anime
and
japanese
culture
,
is
a
pocky
lover
.

It
’s
good
yummy
stuff
!

(
OT
:
and
now
she
’s
taking
Japanese	B	Japanese	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000
language
in
college
and
really
liking
it
a
lot
;
very
encouraging
development
for
a
“
non-language
”
Geology
major
that
hated
High
School
Spanish
)
.

As
to
your
kittehs
,
it
’s
wonderful
to
hear
that
Sei
(
and
you
CJ
)

are
getting
thought
the
transition
.

Our
household
is
working
through
the
loss
of
one
of
our
three
dogs
.

The
adjustments
are
hard
for
two
and
four
footed
members
of
the
family
,
but
we
’re
doing
ok
.

If
you
are
going
to
eat
pocky
,
then
try
to
find
a
bottle
or
two
of
ramune
,
which
is
a
type
of
japanese
soda
.

Many
different
flavors
,
and
there
is
a
marble-type
ball
inside
the
bottle
to
add
to
the
experience
.

My
son
is
addicted
(
I
think
he
is
a
changeling
,
japanese
style
)
.

is

a
consistently
solid
collection
of
short
stories
,
never
published
before

being

book
.

More
than
one
made
best
of

only

high

,
and
even
had
the
rather
lofty
goal
of
starting

another
upsurge
in
horror
sales
.

While

They
call
it
'
Dr
Copper
'
-
the
metal
with
a
PhD
in
economics
-
because
of
its
forecasting
ability.It
turned
up
in
2003
as
the
world
recovered
from
the
dotcom
crash
.

It
peaked
in
2008
,
shortly
before
the
stock
market
crash
,
and
it
rebounded
in
2009
.

Sounds
great
.

But
in
fact
,
if
you
look
at
it
,
copper
actually
rises
and
falls
with
general
market
sentiment
.

It
's
more
of
a
barometer
than
forecaster.A
far
better
forecaster
would
be
a
metal
that
moves
before
the
event
,
a
metal
that
peaks
or
troughs
early
--
in
late
2006
,
early
2007
,
say
,
or
in
2010
.

Such
a
metal
exists
.

It
's
copper
's
less
widely
discussed
,
less
glamorous
industrial
cousin
:
zinc.So
what
can
it
tell
us
about
today
's
market
?

And
what
's
the
best
way
to
play
it?Zinc
is
n't
glamorous
or
world-savingUnlike
uranium
,
rare
earth
metals
,
or
even
gold
and
silver
,
zinc
is
not
a
metal
that
is
going
to
save
the
world
.

It
's
not
the
answer
to
looming
energy
,
technical
or
monetary
problems.Its
main
use
(
over
50
%
)
is
in
galvanising
,
to
prevent
rust
.

Zinc
is
very
reactive
,
so
a
quick
coat
of
zinc
on
your
iron
or
steel
will
attract
all
the
oxidisation
and
protect
the
metal
beneath
.

It
's
also
used
extensively
in
alloys
(
brass
and
bronze
in
particular
)
and
compounds
.

You
'll
find
zinc
in
a
huge
range
of
applications
,
from
communication
equipment
to
coins
to
cars
to
piping
to
bearings
to
water
valves.It
's
widely
used
(
only
iron
ore
,
copper
and
aluminium
are
more
heavily
used
)
.

But
there
's
no
huge
deficit
between
global
zinc
supply
and
demand
to
get
excited
about
--
there
's
lots
of
it
and
when
demand
grows
,
production
can
be
increased
too.Identified
worldwide
resources
are
estimated
at
just
below
the
two
billion
tonne
mark
.

The
largest
deposits
are
in
Canada	B	Canada	Canada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada	000	000

US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
,
Australia	B	Australia	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
and
Iran	B	Iran	Iran	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran	000	000
.

Annual
global
production
stands
at
around
12
million
tonnes
,
70
%
of
which
comes
from
mining
and
30
%
from
recycling.According
to
recent
data
made
available
to
the
International
Lead
and
Zinc
Study
Group
(
ILZSG
)
,
world
demand
exceeded
supply
by
223,000
tonnes
in
2011
,
in
the
year
to
date
.

World
stock
levels
increased
by
201,000
tonnes
,
although

stockpiles
(
along
with
those
of
all

,
interestingly
)
have
been
declining
since
the
summer.From
the
same
data
,
we
see
world
zinc
production
rose
by
14.5
%
;
apparent

A
history
of
the
zinc
priceAs
for
the
zinc
price
,
it
is
trading
in
a
fairly
tight
range
.

Its
year
high
was
just
above
$
1.1
/
lb
in
February
and
its
low
,
in
October
,
was
$
0.80
/
lb.Here
we
see
a
long-term
chart
of
zinc
since
1989
.

It
fell
from
about
$
0.90
/
lb
in
the
late
'80s
to
$
0.40
/
lb
in
1993
,
then
spent
the
rest
of
the
decade
mired
in
a
tight
range
between
$
0.40
and
$
0.55
or
so
,
with
one
brief
spike
above
that
level.After
the
dotcom
crash
,
it
sunk
even
below
$
0.40
/
lb
until
2003
when
it
began
to
creep
up
--
in
line
with
general
market
sentiment.But
then
in
2004-5
it
broke
out
above
that
multi-year
$
0.50
/
lb
or
so
cap
and
within
two
years
quadrupled
.

In
late
2006
it
broke
above
$
2/lb
.

Insane
stuff
.

If
ever
there
is
a
chart
that
reflects
the
bubble
of
credit
and
speculative
excess
the
world
got
itself
into
in
that
period
,
it
's
this
one.Then
the
zinc
price
began
falling
--
ahead
of
the
markets
--
and
quickly
returned
to
$
0.50
/
lb
break-out
point
,
giving
back
all
of
the
gains
of
the
previous
two
or
three
years.We
then
got
the
proverbial
'
dead
cat
bounce
'
,
which
petered
out
at
$
1.20
in
2010
.

We
have
been
stuck
in
a
range
ever
since
,
between
there
and
$
0.80
on
the
downside
.

This
month
it
has
turned
back
up.Professor
Zinc
's
psychic
powersI
would
say
Professor
Zinc	B	Zinc	Zinc	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc	000	000
better
reflects
the
real
global
state
of
things
than
the
Dr
Copper	B	Copper	Copper	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper	000	000
.

In
July
2008
copper
was
making
new
highs
(
with
oil
)
,
when
zinc
had
long-since
turned
down
,
and
the
credit
crunch
was
in
full
flight.In
early
2011
,
copper
made
new
highs
again
,
above
2006
and
2007
levels
--
when
the
real
economy
was
in
a
more
parlous
state
.

Here
's
a
chart
of
copper
over
that
period
.

To
me
,
it
is
less
a
reflection
of
the
economy
and
more
a
reflection
of
the
speculative
excess
at
the
extreme
end
of
finance.So
what
is
zinc
telling
us
now?It
has
turned
up
,
and
I
see
some
buying
coming
back
into
the
junior
mining
end
of
markets
,
so
perhaps
we
can
expect
this
rally
to
continue
until
Christmas	B	Christmas	Christmas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas	000	000
and
even
into
the
New	B	New Year	New_Year	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year	000	000
Year	I	New Year	New_Year	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year	000	000
.

But
there
are
plenty
of
problems
lurking
on
the
sidelines
,
as
we
all
know
,
so
I
would
be
ready
to
jump
ship
should
they
rear
their
ugly
heads
again
.

And
I
'll
be
watching
closely
to
see
if
the
zinc
price
provides
an
early
warning
of
the
next
downturn.If
you
wanted
to
trade
zinc
,
ETF	B	ETF Securities	ETF_Securities	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETF_Securities	000	000
Securities	I	ETF Securities	ETF_Securities	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETF_Securities	000	000
offers
a
zinc
ETF	B	ETF	Exchange-traded_fund	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund	000	000
(
LSE	B	LSE	London_Stock_Exchange	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange	000	000
:
ZINC	B	ZINC	Zinc	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc	000	000
)
.

But
I
ca
n't
see
the
point
.

I
do
n't
see
huge
price
rises
in
zinc
itself
coming
.

The
top
large-cap
zinc-producing
companies
include
Xstrata	B	Xstrata	Xstrata	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xstrata	000	000
,
OZ	B	OZ Minerals	OZ_Minerals	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OZ_Minerals	000	000
Minerals	I	OZ Minerals	OZ_Minerals	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OZ_Minerals	000	000
,
Teck	B	Teck Cominco	Teck_Resources	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teck_Resources	000	000
Cominco	I	Teck Cominco	Teck_Resources	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teck_Resources	000	000
and
Glencore	B	Glencore	Glencore_Xstrata	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glencore_Xstrata	000	000
,
all
of
which
may
be
ripe
for
a
rally
to
early
next
year.However
,
the
small-caps
offer
more
growth
potential
.

One
suggestion
for
a
small-cap
,
pure
play
on
zinc
is
the
former
golden
boy
ZincOx
resources
(
Aim
:
ZOX
)
,
a
company
whose
management
I
like.I
should
also
mention
Toronto
Venture
Exchange-listed
Vena
Resources
(
TSX	B	TSX	Toronto_Stock_Exchange	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Stock_Exchange	000	000
:
VEM
)
,
a
company
I
have
mentioned
here
before
.

It
is
bringing
a
zinc
mine
into
production
in
Peru	B	Peru	Peru	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru	000	000
and
,
according
to
reports
,
it
has
made
good
progress
.

Vena
has
been
hammered
this
year
for
two
reasons.First
,
there
was
a
lot
of
(
probably
misplaced
)
risk
perceived
about
the
new
Peruvian	B	Peruvian	Peru	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru	000	000
government
being
mining
unfriendly
.

Second
,
Vena
is
also
exploring
large
uranium
deposits
and
the
market
fell
horribly
out
of
love
with
uranium
after
Fukushima	B	Fukushima	Fukushima_Prefecture	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Prefecture	000	000
.

But
below

Vena
offers
potential
value
and
growth
(
I
hold
the
stock
myself
)

Before
we
get
under
way
with
today
’s
chat
,
a
little
news
...
.

A
two-day
RYL
in
Perth
!

Hi
Team
.

A
little
while
ago
I
was
approached
by
the
very
lovely
Susie
James
and
her
team
from
Funny
Farm
Fitness
in
WA	B	WA	Washington_(state)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)	000	000
to
run
a
two-day
(
live-in
)
RYL
Program
for
her
and
her
clients
from
July
31
--
August
2
.

Susie
has
kindly
agreed
to
open
the
program
up
to
anyone
from
the
West
(
or
East
for
that
matter
)
who
might
like
to
come
along
for
two
days
of
life-changing
motivation
,
inspiration
and
education
.

The
program
will
be
identical
to
the
one
we
’re
running
here
in
Victoria	B	Victoria	Victoria_(Australia)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)	000	000
next
month
.

Although
I
will
be
two
months
older
.

And
wiser
.

Okay
,
older
.

If
you
would
like
to
book
a
place
or
talk
to
Susie
,
she
can
be
contacted
during
business
hours
on
0438 910 664
or
you
can
email
her
at
funnyfarmfitness@bigpond.com
.

The
venue
for
the
program
is
Club
Capricorn
,
Two
Rocks
Road
,
Yanchep
.

I
hope
to
see
some
of
you
there
.

Vertically
Challenged

Most
of
my
long-time
readers
will
know
that
as
a
teenager
I
was
a
somewhat
...
er
.

.

voluptuous
.

Full-figured
.

Thick-set
.

Stocky
.

Big-boned
.

Solid
.

Sure
the
experts
might
have
classified
me
as
obese
,
but
I
preferred
to
see
myself
as
...
short
for
my
weight
.

Vertically
challenged
for
my
mass
.

It
was
totally
about
my
height
and
not
my
weight
.

See
,
it
’s
a
perspective
thing
.

Or
a
denial
thing
.

Okay
,
I
was
a
whopper
.

Buttons
Being
Pushed

Anyway
,
a
few
of
the
ex-fat
kid
’s
buttons
have
been
pushed
lately
because
there
has
been
talk
here
in
the
Land
Down
Under
about
weighing
kids
at
school
in
a
kind
of
annual
physiological
assessment
;
essentially
a
height
measurement
,
some
weighing
and
a
BMI	B	BMI	Body_mass_index	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index	000	000
calculation
.

I
can
hear
the
screams
of
protest
starting
before
I
even
finish
this
sentence
.

But
what
if
it
’s
done
in
a
completely
clinical
manner
and
only
the
parent
,
the
clinician
and
the
child
know
the
outcome
of
the
test
?

Does
the
idea
still
suck
then
?

Does
the
idea
suck
at
all
?

Maybe
you
like
it
?

Perhaps
the
only
way
to
address
childhood
obesity
is
in
a
practical
manner
such
as
this
?

After
all
,
it
gives
us
a
measurable
,
objective
and
scientific
assessment
of
where
the
child
is
at
and
how
they
are
tracking
over
time
.

More
Education
?

Surely
,
if
the
answer
to
the
obesity
problem
was
to
pump
the
kids
and
parents
full
of
more
information
,
then
our
kids
would
be
shrinking
by
the
day
because
we
’ve
got
obesity-related
information
and
education
coming
out
of
our
ears
...
yet
they
ai
n’t
gettin
’
no
smaller
.

Er
,
any
smaller
.

What
do
You
Think
?

Today
’s
instalment
is
more
of
a
discussion
than
it
is
a
lesson
,
so
I
look
forward
to
seeing
what
the
group
consensus
will
be
on
this
topic
.

I
think
the
idea
has
some
merit
but
I
’m
not
totally
sold
.

I
would
need
to
know
a
little
more
about
how
the
overall
concept
would
be
implemented
and
developed
over
the
long
term
before
I
could
give
it
my
tick
of
approval
.

And
we
all
know
how
much
the
government
values
my
opinion
.

As
an
ex-fatty
,
I
think
I
would
have
appreciated
a
little
short-term
pain
for
some
long-term
gain
.

But
then
again
,
maybe
the
chocolate
cake-eating
,
fat
fourteen
year-old
‘
me
’
would
think
that
his
older
counterpart
is
a
big
tool
.

Your
thoughts
?

About
the
weighing
that
is
.

Not
whether
or
not
I
’m
a
tool
.

you
’re
not

you
chronic
Lurkers

Also
,
let
me
know
how
you
’re
going
with
the
abstaining
from
arguing
thing
(
off
the

of

The
argument
supporting
school
weigh-ins
seems
to
be
that
it
would
be
no
different
from
ear
tests
and
eye
tests
etc.
.

I
am
a
school
teacher
and
I
firmly
believe
there
is
a
huge
difference
.

Children
compare
results
all
the
time
,
they
care
very
little
between
their
hearing
and
sight
tests
compared
to
how
much
they
would
about
weight
.

Please
remember
how
competetive
children
are
and
how
cruel
they
can
be
in
their
comparisons
that
would
inevitably
result
from
these
weigh-ins
.

If
parents
limited
the
time
their
child
spends
on
low-activity
such
as
television
watching
,
DVDs
,
computer
and
other
electronic
games
we
would
n’t
need
to
weigh
kids
in
school.Ally

I
remember
two
days
in
particular
from
my
school
days
(
err
years
--
all
13
of
them
)
.

The
first
was
in
Grade	B	Grade 5	Fifth_grade	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_grade	000	000
5	I	Grade 5	Fifth_grade	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_grade	000	000
or
6
.

We
all
got
weighed
and
it
was
writen
on
a
chart
.

For
all
to
see
.

What
purpose
does
that
serve
?

I
hated
it
.

The
second
day
was
in
Yr
7
.

First
class
of
physical
education
for
the
year
we
were
all
lined
up
and
got
weighed
by
teacher
.

Kids
all
share
their
weight
.

Just
like
saying
‘
what
did
you
get
[
in
the
maths
test
]
.
’

Then
we
did
the
dreaded
‘
beep
test
’
(
shuttle
run
it
’s
also
called
)
.

I
loved
that
as
much
as
you
loved
Swimming
Carnival
day
.

I
’d
maybe
give
it
the
heads
up
if
I
knew
more
about
the
process
and
what
they
would
do
,
as
a
school
to
help
improve
it
.

Maybe
Mr
Rudd
(
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
prime
minister
)
could
fund
daily
small
group
fitness
sessions
at
your
kids
gym
all
year
round
?

Well
it
may
surprise
you
but
this
already
happens
in
many
secondary
schools
in
Victoria	B	Victoria	Victoria_(Australia)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)	000	000
as
part
of
a
physical
education
class
...
.

.

BMIs
are
worked
out
and
then
fitness
tests
are
completed
.

Supposedly
all
in
private
and
very
sensitively
done
...
.

BUT
in
my
experience
as
a
secondary
teacher
(
no
not
phys
ed
)
the
teachers
conducting
these
tests
are
already
the
fit
and
sporty
ones
...
and
hence
have
little
concept
of
the
pain
caused
to
those
who
are
not
so
fit
or
sporty
...
although
it
is
private
everyone
knows
who
is
fit/overweight
etc
and
it
does
nothing
except
cause
the
unfit
ones
to
manufacture
excuses
...
forge
notes
or
wag
school
to
avoid
these
dreaded
weighings
...
.

i
‘
get
’
that
in
theory
it
seems
a
good
idea
but
in
practise
(
to
me
)
it
only
seems
to
cement
the
negative
body
image
which
these
kids
already
have
...
.

it
my
mind
we
should
do
more
to
encourage
even
the
‘
non
sporty
’
ones
to
enjoy
sport
rather
than
constantly
rewarding
those
who
are
‘
good
’
until
the
others
give
up
...
...
.

.

very
very
few
girls
continue
with
sport
after
year
10
...
.

and
no
one
makes
a
move
to
reverse
this
trend
...
.

well
these
are
my
thoughts
anyway

In
theory
I
can
see
some
merit
in
this
,
to
help
children
become
more
educated
about
food
and
exercise
.

In
practise
however
I
think
the
psychological
damage
it
may
do
some
children
would
far
outweigh
the
benefits
of
such
a
program
.

The
teasing
and
bullying
that
goes
on
already
in
schools
is
n’t
completely
able
to
be
managed
now
,
I
feel
this
may
give
more
negative
feedback
to
children
.

Fat
kids
know
they
are
fat
,
they
do
n’t
need
to
be
weighed
to
be
told
that
.

I
have
a
friend
whose
son
is
fat
,
he
knows
it
and
has
been
bullied
at
school
because
of
it
.

One
day
(
after
reading
Craig
’s
book
I
had
a
better
idea
of
how
to
approach
her
on
the
topic
)
I
did
talk
to
her
about
how
she
could
help
him
,
instead
of
managing
the
bullying
problem
through
the
school
,
look
at
giving
her
son
the
information
he
needs
to
start
losing
weight
(
she
is
unable
to
help
him
too
much
and
he
is
11
years
old
)
.

She
has
lined
him
up
with
my
PT	B	PT	Pacific_Time_Zone	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Time_Zone	000	000
(
who
is
great
and
has
kids
of
her
own
)
and
she
’ll
keep
him
moving
in
the
right
direction
,
and
he
’s
also
shown
an
interest
in
a
couple
of
sports
so
hopefully
he
’ll
start
to
see
a
change
soon
!

He
also
loves
the
feedback
he
has
been
getting
from
our
PT
so
it
’s
starting
to
work
.

So
after
that
rant
,
I
can
see
the
pluses
but
then
I
can
see
the
problems
too
,
I
think
it
would
be
better
to
be
run
maybe
through
the
school
but
not
as
a
compulsory
school
thing
(
maybe
talk
to
the
parents
of
overweight
children
)
so
there
is
n’t
such
a
stigma
attached
to
it
.

School
sucks
,
even
when
you
are
n’t
a
fat
kid
--
why
make
it
harder
than
it
already
is
.

Hi
Craig
,

As
a
paremt
(
and
having
my
own
weight
issues
)
it
would
n’t
bother
me
having
my
kids
weighed
.

My
kids
have
always
been
slightly
underweight
anyway
.

For
a
good
few
years
my
son
hardly
ate
a
thing
...
.

which
was
a
great
worry
to
me
as
he
was
all
bones
.

He
was
on
meds
for
adhd
and
they
can
act
like
an
appetite
suppressant
.

He
was
38kg
3
years
ago
and
he
has
now
just
turned
16
.

(
I
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
worried
about
it
though
.

One
paed
we
saw
told
me
to
feed
him
icecream
...
very
useful
!!!

We
do
n’t
see
him
any
more
.
)

He
now
eats
fairly
well
(
although
vegies
are
a
huge
challenge
lol
)
and
is
up
around
the
62kg
at
about
5
’
9
″
My
daughter
is
also
(
slightly
)
underweight
for
her
height
but
is
very
healthy
.

(
she
will
eat
her
vegies
)
Both
see
a
paediatrician

and
she
is
not
worried
about
them
.
)

Not
too
sure
the
weighing
of
kids
in
schools
will
change
anything
for
them
though
as
it
is
then
up
to
the
parents
to
do
something
about
and
will
they
???

Could
we
be
starting
a
body
image
problem
especially
with
the
young
girls
.

Will
they
be
testing
these
kids
every
year
and
are
we
only
talking
primary
??

(
too
many
questions
??

sorry
)

OOh
another
day
goes
by
and
no
arguments
...
wow
.

Although
my
son
is
at
his
dad
’s
and
he
is
the
one
I
most
talk
“
loudly
”
with
lol
He
will
be

on
Sunday
.

That
is
when
the
real

begins

Hey
Craig
,
From
being
not
a
school
fatty
but
to
being
a
fatty
mummy
myself
later
in
life
,
I
say
,
yes
to
the
school
weighing
and
measuring
,
but
the
information
needs
to
go
to
the
parents
.

The
parents
are
responsible
for
what
the
kids
eat
.

I
have
recently
lost
32kg
’s
and
in
the
process
my
son
,
has
gone
from
the
school
yard
fatty
to
a
very
thinned
out
and
sporty
young
man
.

The
only
adjustments
to
his
diet
and
lifestyle
were
the
ones
I
made
myself
.

I
started
eating
properly
,
so
did
he
,
I
started
excercising
on
the
weekends
,
they
had
to
come
with
me
.

But
if
you
had
of
asked
my
2
years
ago
,
was
my
son
fat
,
I
would
have
said
NO
WAY
,
but
to
look
back
he
really
was
.

Get
the
parents
more
active
and
our
kids
wont
be
so
fat
.

What
do
you
think
?

Hi
Craig
,

A
new
program
has
just
been
launched
in
New	B	New South Wales	New_South_Wales	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales	000	000
South	I	New South Wales	New_South_Wales	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales	000	000
Wales	I	New South Wales	New_South_Wales	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales	000	000
schools
which
allows
students
to
register
their
physical
activity
,
sports
,
dance
etc
over
a
certain
period
in
order
to
receive
a
certificate
(
and
perhaps
prizes
?
)

for
themselves
and
their
school
.

It
’s
a
little
like
the
Premier	B	Premier	Premier	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier	000	000
’s
Reading
Challenge
.

I
feel
this
is
a
far
more
positive
approach
than
the
big
weigh-in
.

One
should
reward
good
efforts
rather
than
humiliate
children
for
poor
performance
.

I
would
be
very
reluctant
to
support
a
school-based
fitness
assessment
.

As
a
parent
,
I
want
to
be
responsible
for
my
children
’s
health
and
wellbeing
--
not
some
clipboard
weilding
weight-Nazi
.

As
a
teacher
,
I
feel
that
we
expect
schools
to
solve
all
of
society
’s
problems
and
relieve
parents
of
their
rights
and
responsibilities
in
terms
of
their
children
’s
development
.

The
obesity
epidemic
needs
to
be
solved
in
the
kitchen
,
not
the
classroom
.

Looking
forward
to
hearing
everyone
else
’s
thoughts
on
this
topic
too
.

Enjoy
your
Wednesday

I
think
the
education
kids
need
to
be
given
should
be
more
than
just
what
the
food
groups
are
and
basic
nutrition
concepts
,
they
need
to
be
taught
how
to
live
healthily
and
what
the
right
and
wrong
choices
are
,
whether
it
be
at
school
or
at
home
.

I
wish
someone
helped
me
when
I
was
an
extremely
overweight
kid
and
taught
me
portion
control
.

I
think
kids
shoud
be
weighed
and
then
there
should
be
options
for
these
kids
to
enrol
in
an
after
school
program
where
they
can
be
assisted
to
lose
weight
.

Their
weiht
does
not
need
to
be
put
on
a
notice
board
but
at
least
they
need
to
know
.

Is
there
really
a
childhood
obesity
crisis
?

I
look
around
my
kids
’
primary
school
and
hardly
a
fat
kid
in
sight
.

Perhaps
it
’s
more
endemic
in
low
socio
economic
areas
.

At
the
end
of
the
day
parents
are
the
ones
who
are
in
control
and
therefore
responsible
for
their
child
’s
health
.

A
kid
can
only
eat
the
food
the
parent
provides
.

It
would
be
more
effective
to
run
programs
to
educate
the
parents
of
obese
kids
how
to
live
a
healthy
and
active
life
.

Geez
.

.

Do
n’t
think
such
a
good
idea
,
as
a
lot
of
kids
big
small
short
tall
are
already
under
extreme
pressure
at
school
without
throwing
this
at
them
.

I
personally
think
that
kids
need
more
help
focussing
on
posiitive
things
rather
than
what
could
be
a
very
negative
thing
.

A
child
who
is
happy
,
positive
,
enthusiastic
etc
probably
would
n’t
be
self
medicating
.

Maybe
the
people
who
earn
the
money
should
invest
in
their
children
,
rather
than
MuckDonalds
,
playstation
etc.
.

Kids
are
little
people
who
should
be
treated
with
the
same
respect
as
big
people
and
I
am
sure
I
have
n’t
heard
of
compulsory
weigh
ins
before
work
each
day
in
either
the
public
or
private
sector
??!!

Maybe
that
is
the
answer

this

I

physical
education
is
a
requirement
and
so
once
every

we
used
to
have
to
do
the
fitness
assessment
--
how
fast
can
you
run
the
mile
,
how
many
pushups
can
you
do
,
how
many
sit-ups
,
can
you
climb
the
rope
,
how
many
pull
ups
,
how
far
can
you
sit
and
reach
and
yes
they
did
weigh
you
and
do
a
fat
test
(
with
calibers
)
.

Every
thing
was
in
front
of
your
phys

except
for
the
weight
and
fat
test

those
were
done
private

As

the
greatest
shape
I
never
looked
forward
to
these
days
,
but
it
was
never
a
surprise
where
people
finished
--
you
can
tell
who
the
fit
kids
are
and
who
they
are
n’t
.

You
pretty
much
already
know
who
is
going
to
come
in
last
on
the
mile
run
and
who
is
going
to
be
done
in
less
than
7
minutes
(
the
track
people
,
of
course
!
)

.

Kids
already
know
if
they
are
fat
or
not
fit
so
I
do
n’t
see
the
harm
either
way
.

As
long
as
you
are
n’t
weighed
in
front
of
others
and
those
numbers
do
n’t
become
public
--
it
is
a
good
way
to
keep
track
.

I
had
a
very
nice
phys
ed
teacher
who
wanted
to
work
with
the
overweight
kids
and
try
to
help
them
get
more
active
--
but
I
suppose
this
is
easier
to
do
in
a
small
school
such
as
mine
--
maybe
larger
schools
are
different
.

All
in
all
though
--
not
a
bad
idea
.

i
do
not
think
children
should
be
subjected
to
being
weighed
in
school
as
this
can
start
bullying
,
and
what
good
would
it
do
?

we
really
have
to
re-educate
everyone
into
to
realising
we
are
only
killing
ourselves
and
our
children.Here
in
Scotland
we
have
a
massive
problem
too
as
i
see
children
every
day
being
given
cakes
and
sweets
before
8am
,
why
?

I
was
a
“
fat
”
child
and
my
life
at
school
was
hell
and
have
recently
lost
over
13stones
and
it
makes
me
angry
when
i
see
people
feeding
“
crap
”
yo
their
kids
,
the
problem
is
in
the
home
not
at
school

I
have
a
child
with
a
high
body
mass
because
he
is
medicated
for
another
condition
.

(
Interestingly
,
he
has
16
%
body
fat
,
but
is
44kg
and
138cm
tall
,
so
theoretically
,
his
BMI	B	BMI	Body_mass_index	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index	000	000
is
way
too
high
)
.

I
think
he
would
be
really
embarrassed
to
be
weighed
at
school
as
people
might
ask
why
,
and
his
medication
is
private
.

If
he
got
left
out
of
the
weighing
,
people
might
also
ask
why
.

I
think
a
lot
of
children
’s
psyches
are
as
important
as
their
physical
bodies
.

I
totally
support
this
idea
if
there
is
a
plan
to
also
provide
further
education
to
both
the
students
and
parents
about
appropriate
nutrition
and
exercise
.

A
weigh
in
by
itself
is
pointless
,
without
a
sound
means
of
helping
students
combat
less
than
desirable
results
.

Last
year
I
lost
over
25
kilograms
at
weight
watchers
mainly
by
learning
about
portion
size
.

As
a
child
I
was
active
and
ate
reasonably
healthy
meals
and
snacks
,
however
I
look
back
now
and
realise
being
overweight
was
mainly
to
do
with
the
fact
I
was
eating
twice
as
much
as
I
should
have
been
.

If
I
had
been
armed
with
this
information
15
--
20
years
ago
,
potentially
I
would
n’t
have
been
overweight
for
half
of
my
life

Hello

Do

when

I
think
I
’m
with
the
above
teacher
’s
comments
on
this
one
--
a
program
that
boosts
kids
self
image
and
self
esteem
(
no
matter
what
their
weight
)
would
possibly
do
more
good
than
a
height/weight/bmi
assessment
.

Perhaps
if
the
initial
assessment
(
offered
as
non-compulsory
)
was
followed
up
with
some
self
development
(
kids
style
)
and
a
fitness
program
they
(
the
government
)
might
be
on
the
right
track
.

As
parents
and
teachers
we
should
be
about
empowering
our
kids
(
and
not
just
academnically
)
so
that
they
can
realise
their
potential
physically
and
psychologically
.

A
bmi/height/weight
assessment
would
only
compound
what
they
probably
already
believe
about
themselves
--
ie
that
they
’re
not
good
enough
.

They
might
be
kids
--
but
let
’s
get
them
‘
thinking
right
’
(
about
themselves
)
first
--
everyone
always
comments
that
kids
are
‘
like
sponges
’
and
can
learn
anything
--
so
I
say
let
’s
fill
them
up
with
some
positive
thoughts
about
themselves
.

A
weight/height/bmi
assessment
is
really
useless
unless
it
is
followed
or
preceded
by
some
life
skills
and
self
empowering
beliefs
(
once
again
kid
style
)
.

Our
school
is
pretty
good
with
all
that
kind
of
thing
,
so
perhaps
it
would
all
come
down
to
how
individual
schools
(
and
principals
)
handled
and
introduced
the
program
.

Anyhow
,
that
’s
my
thoughts
...
.

oh
and
I
’m
all
for
increased
physical
activity
during
their
day
...
we
have
a
walking/wheeling
day
in
our
school
week
where
all
the
kids
are
encouraged
to
walk
or
ride
.

They
get
stickers
and
merit
points
each
week
for
doing
so
...
no
one
even
notices
their
getting
exercise
.

.

they
’re
just
having
fun
.

Okay
,
I
’m
off
...
.

I
feel
I
could
go
on
,
but
I
’d
better
stop
there
!

cheers
,
Mon
(

PS
Well
I
’ll
just
say
one
more
thing
--
it
’s
the
parents
not
school
communities
who
are
responsible
for
their
kids
health
.

Perhaps
...
we
should
have
‘
parent
information
’
nights
to
encourage
people
to
undetake
that
role
more
responsibly

Hi
Craig

A
thought
from
up
here
in
Iceland	B	Iceland	Iceland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland	000	000
.

Here
we
have
weighed
and
measured
height
for
9
year
old
children
since
about
1930
I
think
,
these
data
has
provided
the
nation
a
valuable
tool
to
see
the
development
.

And
we
have
,
as
so
many
other
contries
seen
that
the
numbers
are
going
up
.

I
personally
think
it
is
good
for
both
the
child
and
the
parent
to
get
this
information
on
a
regularly
basis
.

Children
need
to
be
educated
about
health
--
and
I
think
it
is
good
for
them
to
talk
about
the
results
and
see
that
similar
children
can
have
different
numbers
simply
because
off
different
bone
structure
and
body
mass
.

Off
course
it
is
always
difficult
for
the
fat
one
--
but
so
is
gym
,
swimming
and
so
many
other
things
...

Unfortunately
.

.

With
regards
,
Bryndis

I
do
n’t
know
about
anyone
else
’s
experiences
,
but
my
issues
with
weight
made
me
believe
that
I
was
not
just
fat
,
but
also
that
there
was
nothing
redeemable
about
me
.

I
hated
myself
and
my
appearance
so
much
growing
up
,
and
it
was
entirely
because
of
my
weight
.

I
already
knew
I
was
fat
,
but
until
Grade	B	Grade 5	Fifth_grade	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_grade	000	000
5	I	Grade 5	Fifth_grade	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_grade	000	000
(
school
weigh
in
)
,
I
did
n’t
care
about
it
,
because
I
was
happy
.

And
it
was
n’t
until
Grade
12
that
I
was
confident
enough
in
who
I
was
,
and
unhappy
enough
with
what
I
looked
like
,
that
I
could
commit
myself
to
losing
weight
.

If
a
child
is
fat
,
they
know
it
.

Unless
a
child
wants
to
change
,
you
ca
n’t
make
them
.

Full
stop
.

And
saying
to
a
14
year-old
girl
,
“
We
need
to
do
something
about
your
weight
”
,
is
a
soul-destroying
action
,
particularly
if
they
are
n’t
‘
ready
’
for
the
change
.

I
think
it
’s
much
,
much
more
important
that
schools
focus
on
nutrition
and
fitness
--
health
!

--
instead
.

If
I
’d
been
given
the
opportunity
to
‘
explore
new
foods
’
or
‘
let
’s
go
...
(
insert
interesting
activity
)
’
,
I
would
have
been
much
more
likely
to
get
involved
...
rather
than
take
the
suggestion
that
I
need
to
lose
weight
as
a
confirmation
that
I
had
no
redeeming
value
.

Why
not
get
kids
to
count
calories
for
a
week
as
part
of
a
PE	B	PE	Physical_education	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_education	000	000
class
?

We
all
know
KFC	B	KFC	KFC	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC	000	000
is
bad
for
you
,
but
there
’s
a
distinct
difference
in
‘
knowing
’
(
e.g.
I
‘
know
’
how
to
pick
a
lock
!

Can
I
do
it
in
real
life
?

Pfft
,
no
.
)

and

thinking
‘
actually
,
if
I
’m
allowed
x
number
per
day
and
it
takes
up
that
many
,
it
’s
actually
a
lot
.

This
way
,
you
’re
not
just
reinforcing
that
kids
are
overweight
,
you
’re
empowering
them
by
giving
them
the
practical
tools
to
change
it
.

Hi
Craig

At
my
son
’s
school
(
he
’s
in
Year
9
)
,
they
do
beep
tests
,
weigh
and
measure
kids
twice
a
year
.

I
do
n’t
have
a
problem
with
it
.

The
results
are
fo
the
individual
only
to
try
and
show
improvement
throughout
the
year
.

I
do
n’t
have
a
problem
with
it
--
it
’s
a
reality
of
life
to
be
compared
and
deal
with
it
.

I
think
we
need
to
teach
more
about
nutrition
in
schools
--
not
just
the
food
hierarchy
thing
but
realy
nutrition
.

There
’s
not
much
point
targeting
parents
--
most
of
us
have
instilled
in
us
what
we
learnt
and
so
few
are
willing
to
change
.

As
for
yesterday
,
I
snapped
someones
head
off
and
then
felt
like
crap
.

Did
no
good
--
in
fact
made
things
worse
.

My
own
uncontrolled
frustration
.

Will
perservere
today

Oh
my
goodness
!!

You
've
just
sent
me
straight
back
to
school
&
in
grade
3
(
I
think
)
I
was
always
waaaaaay
taller
than
the
other
kids
,
stocky
in
a
half
polynesian
,
dutch
kid
kinda
way
&
I
would
weigh
the
heaviest
!

AND
to
top
it
all
off
,
we
had
a
graph
chart
&
I
was
the
lone
star
at
the
top
of
it
.

It
was
most
embarrassing
to
see
that
&
to
be
thought
of
as
fat
&
heavy
.

I
look
back
at
my
school
pics
&
I
really
wasnt
even
that
fat
...
just
a
head
above
the
rest.By
the
way
,
I
was
never
even
teased
for
being
fat
,
so
I
guess
I
was
just
big
...

must
have
scared
the
little
boys
.

hee
heeOh
the
memories
...
.

So
ummmm
...
.

.

perhaps
a
note
to
all
parents
about
obesity
in
kids
&
they
can
weight
them
themselves
.

If
the
chubby
cherubs
are
still
fatty
boombahs
in
6
months
time
,
perhaps
a
word
to
the
parents
&
a
secret
weigh
in
?

I
du
n
no
.

I
'm
not
a
parent
&
my
nephews
(
3
of
them
under
10
)
are
great
with
their
health
&
exercise.Might
go
eat
a
donut
now

Hi
Craig
,
First
of
all
no
,
your
not
a
tool
lol.I
was
a
plump
kid
at
school
and
i
felt
it
and
i
know
if
it
was
me
being
weighed
I
would
die
of
embarrasement
and
shame
.

with
all
the
takeaway
food
being
shoved
in
their
faces
by
television
and

games
like
the
xboxes
and
nintendos
its
no
wonder
kids
dont
venture
outside
for
fun
.

And
lets
face
it
when
your
on
a
budget
fresh
healthy
food
isnt
cheap
,
and
sometimes
you
have
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
situation
.

Maybe
weighing
the
kids
is
the
solution
but
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
the
information
once
they
have
it
?

Are
we
opening
the
way
for
more
to
have
bulimia
and
anorexia
as
well
as
image
problems
?

Life
can
be
hard
for
kids
,
would
we
be
making
it
easier
or
harder
still
for
them
?

ok
--
not
lurkin
todaythis
made
me
think
about
a
past
post
of
yrs
where
the
mother
insisted
her
son
was
‘
big
boned
’
and
not
overweight
as
you
suggested
.

i
think
alot
of
parents
are
in
denial
and
school
might
be
the
only
place
you
can
access
them
to
inform
and
educat
e
and
beat
them
around
the
head
with
cold
hard
facts
.

im
always
amazed
at
shopping
centre
foodcourts
at
whole
families
who
are
ENORMOUS
including
the
school
age
kids
.

i
think
political
correctness
is
holding
this
issue
back
.

Hi
Craig

Gail
,
I
agree
with
you
100
%
.

In
these
hard
economic
times
,
and
for
those
who
are
really
feeling
it
,
the
budget
only
goes
so
far
and
when
it
comes
to
food
,
it
is
what
is
filling
,
rather
than
what
is
nutritious
,
which
becomes
important
.

I
think
a
‘
weigh
in
’
at
school
would
only
be
detrimental
in
the
long
run
,
wrongly
encouraging
kids
to
focus
on
their
body
image
(
they
have
enough
outside
pressure
as
it
is
without
having
it
dictated
to
them
through
a
weigh
in
at
school
)
.

As
others
have
stated
,
let
’s
focus
on
physical
activities
that
encourage
kids
to
get
up
off
their
bums
and
get
interested
in
something
other
than
the
TV
.

I
have
a
daughter
(
now
26
)
who
was
anorexic
in
her
early
teens
,
due
to
bullying
,
depression
and
bad
body
image
.

I
ca
n’t
begin
to
imagine
how
a
‘
weigh
in
’
would
have
affected
her
.

So
hopefully
common
sense
will
prevail
and
someone
will
come
up
with
a
way
to
get
kids
involved
in
physical
activity
without
focussing
on
weight
,
but
rather
on
having
fun
at
the
same
time
.

Hi
Craig
,

A
very
interesting
article
!

I
too
was
an
overweight
teenager.I
piled
on
all
the
weight
after
I
stopped
all
my
sport
when
entering
highschool
due
to
my
bad
habits
of
consuming
junk
food
after
exercising
,
the
cravings
did
n’t
stop
just
because
I
stopped
sport
!!

My
mother
who
was
naturally
slim
her
whole
life
used
to
try
and
tell
me
not
to
eat
too
much
or
the
wrong
foods
but
in
the
end
we
all
find
ways
to
sneak
it
!!

As
an
adult
I
have
managed
to
get
my
weight
into
submission
through
proper
eating
and
exercise
--
some
of
my
friends
would
argue
that
I
’m
a
little
too
obssessive
but
hey
you
turn
your
back
for
a
short
time
and
boy
can
some
damage
be
done
!!

(
By
the
way
I
loved
your
book
Fattitude
!
)

I
am
a
parent
to
a
gorgeous
girl
who
just
turned
11
,
and
and
a
boy
nearly
10
,
and
try
to
set
a
good
example
for
eating
right
and
exercise
and
have
to
admit
that
I
fight
an
uphill
battle
everyday
!

The
biggest
influence
over
our
kids
I
find
are
their
friends
,
my
daughter
hangs
out
with
two
girls
who
are
both
overweight
and
have
no
interest
in
exercise
(
one
she
played
netball
with
last
year
that
could
barely
last
one
quarter
of
slow
running
around
the
court
!
)

and
as
such
through
their
constant
bagging
of
my
daughters
’
diet
and
love
of
sport
,
have
noticed
that
she
is
constantly
trying
to
get
out
of
sport
and
constantly
questions
me
about
why
I
make
her
eat
what
I
do
,
such
as
can
you
believe
it

SALAD
!!!??

My
son
hangs
out
with
boys
that
just
run
around
all
day
and
just
burn
energy
at
an
insane
rate
--
they
do
n’t
have
time
to
eat
!!

And
just
wolfs
down
what
ever
I
put
down
in
front
of
him
.

My
point
is
,
in
a
long
winded
manner
is
,
that
I
do
n’t
think
weighing
and
measuring
would
accomplish
much
without
a
lot
of
effort
going
into
educating
the
parents
about
nutrition
first
,
and
then
in
turn
teaching
kids
about
nutrition
.

I
look
in
absolute
horror
at
some
of
the
things
parents
give
their
kids
to
eat
with
out
even
realising
the
damage
!

Just
go
to
your
local
pool
/
rec
centre
after
a
swinmming
lesson
and
look
at
all
those
hot
chips
walking
out
the
door
!!

At
the
junior
footy
/
soccer
/
netball
what
is
everyone
eating
??

Pies
,
sausage
rolls
,
lollies
at
half
time
because
oranges
are
too
expensive
now

...
.

what
are
we
thinking
!!

Finally
I
think
exercise
should
be
done
everyday
whether
as
a
family
,
walk
on
the
beach
,
walk
in
the
park
,
etc.
.

Or
take
up
a
sport
that
you
can
do
with
your
kids
,
you
are
already
going
there
and
waiting
so
why
not
join
in
??

My
husband
and
I
have
taken
up
taekwondo
with
our
kids
and
we
love
it
,
we
really
are
n’t
that
good
but
the
kids
love
seeing
us
there
with
them
,
and
I
notice
even
the
teens
with
their
parents
just
love
the
common
ground
they
share
!

It
’s
not
that
hard
!

Hey
Craig
!

I
have
a
beautiful
14
yr
old
granddaughter
who
is
...
fat
.

She
plays
more
sport
than
my
skinny
grandkids
(
which
is
a
lot
)
and
is
extremely
good
at
it
.

In
fact
,
two
years
in
a
row
,
she
’s
won
a
sports
scholarship
at
high
school
.

She
’s
immensely
popular
and
well
respected
,
she
’s
form
captain
,
she
has
more
friends
than
I
’ve
had
in
a
lifetime
,
she
has
a
wonderful
personality
and
is
an
all
round
great
kid
.

She
is
a
big
girl
,
as
in
tall
,
and
she
knows
she
is
overweight
,
but
it
does
n’t
seem
to
worry
her
.

She
eats
good
food
...
but
too
much
of
it
.

With
the
amount
of
activity
in
her
life
though
,
it
still
surprises
me
that
she
is
so
big
.

Her
Mum
(
my
daughter
)
has
never
been
fat
,
and
her
little
sister
does
n’t
have
weight
problems
.

Her
father
’s
side
of
the
family
are
n’t
skinny
,
but
they
’re
not
obese
either
.

I
wish
I
had
an
answer
...

Hi
Craig
.

.

Goood
post
.

I
havent
read
any
other
comments
as
yet
so
i
hope
i
dont
repeat
anything
or
upset
anyone
with
my
humble
opinion
.

I
have
3
kids
...
all
raised
in
the
same
house
by
the
same
parent
(
me
)
eating
the
same
thing
.

2
of
my
kids
look
like
praying
mantis
--
all
arms
and
legs
,
stick
figures
and
1
is
,
was
...
.

fat
!!

I
can
tell
you
first
hand
the
effect
of
weighing
children
has
had
in
my
house.That
fat
kid
who
is
now
a
healthy
weight
now
eats
very
little
and
I
have
to
watch
closely
that
she
’s
not
off
spewing
or
spitting
her
meals
up
.

Her
grandmother
(
a
fat
woman
)
use
to
weigh
the
kids
without
my
knowledge
and
she
also
taught
my
eldest
(
not
so
fat
anymore
)
kid
to
just
chew
her
food
for
the
flavour
and
then
spit
it
out
.

Can
we
say
Dickhead
,
much
?

I
am
completely
opposed
to
weighing
kids
in
schools
.

Even
as
adults
we
know
we
shouldnt
be
caught
in
the
numbers
game
.

Kids
(
and
some
uneducated
grandmothers
)
can
be
cruel
and
judgemental
.

We
can
tell
by
looking
at
each
other
if
we
’re
over
weight
,
we
dont
need
to
know
the
number
.

If
I
found
out
this
was
happening
,
I
would
fail
horribly
at
that
whole
‘
lets
not
argue
for
28
days
’
thing
!!

I
would
not
be
happy
.

Oh
and
on
that
note
...

I
havent
argued
with
a
soul
since
I
last
posted
,
not
even
the
snooty
,
hair
flickin
,
food
spittin
’
16
year
old
.

Yay

How
about
we
just
teach
kids
about
the
benefits
of
eating
cleanly
and
the
side
effects
of
eating
junk
food
instead
?

I
’m
not
sure
I
see
the
benefits
of
this
test
for
a
child
--
children
ca
n’t
eat
crap
if
it
is
n’t
purchased
for
them
.

I
think
the
schools
should
teach
healthy
eating
and
copy
the
info
for
the
parents
who
continue
to
fill
their
children
’s
lunch
boxes
with
junk
.

Let
’s
create
healthy
eating
habits
now
for
our
kids
.

I
“
knew
”
my
whole
life
I
was
fat
,
this
had
more
to
do
with
how
my
parents
thought
about
themselves
than
my
own
actual
weight
.

This
had
it
’s
biggest
impact
in
that
I
did
n’t
want
to
join
in
activities
and
sport
because
I
felt
like
I
’d
be
letting
everyone
else
in
the
team
down
.

This
went
right
through
high
school
as
well
.

I
am
obese
now
but
losing
it
(
painfully
slowly
but
losing
it
)
and
my
whole
focus
with
my
health
is
how
to
set
the
best
possible
example
for
my
daughter
.

Being
active
,
eating
right
and
demonstrating
those
basic
healthy
living
skills
to
her
is
my
job
as
parent
and
that
’s
what
i
do
.

As
for
weighing
in
schools
,
I
feel
that
it
’s
better
to
have
a
system
in
place
where
every
child
has
to
go
and
see
their
GP
at
regular
intervals
that
continues
after
the
age
of
4
,
where
they
can
get
weighed
and
measured
and
if
there
is
any
concern
the
child
,
the
parent
and
their
GP
can
work
together
to
resolve
any
issues
there
may
be
.

This
is
what
I
will
do
with
my
daughter
regardless
as
i
feel
that
’s
the
best
way
to
get
help
with
any
problems
and
the
only
way
to
keep
it
clinical
,
personal
and
the
least
traumatic
.

Having
a
better
balance
of
activity
and
education
in
school
is
beneficial
to
everyone
,
kids
find
it
easier
to
concentrate
and
teachers
have
better
focused
kids
so
having
wider
ranging
not
only
fitness
but
activity
programs
in
school
would
have
to
be
a
good
thing
,
some
kids
do
n’t
do
well
with
the
team
thing
,
some
do
n’t
do
well
with
sport
,
but
there
is
so
much
more
to
healthy
activity
than
just
these
things
.

Someone
mentioned
an
activity
challenge
(
like
the
premiers
reading
challenge
)
and
that
would
be
perfect
for
kids
like
I
was
,
being
able
to
make
more
of
an
individual
effort
earlier
on
may
have
meant
that
as
a
healthier
teenager
team
sport
would
n’t
have
been
such
a
daunting
thing
.

To
sum
up-Activity
-
home
and
school
thing
.

Health
and
weight
-
home
and
doctors
thing
.

PS
Society
is
bombarded
enough
by
WEIGHT
,
I
know
this
because
my
husbands
8yo
nephew
the
other
day
came
to
the
dining
table
saying
he
would
like
a
FAT
BLASTER
(
or
some
new
fad
in
exercise
machines
,
ca
n’t
remember
the
name
)
for
his
next
birthday
,
when
asked
why
he
replied
because
he
was
fat
.

The
kids
a
toothpick
,
but
he
religiously
watches
biggest
loser
with
his
mum
every
night
and
hears
constantly
about
his
mum
and
nan
’s
most
recent
diet
fad
.

The
kid
is
not
healthy
(
too
much
technology
,
not
enough
activity
)
,
but
there
is
no
way
he
should
be
thinking
he
’s
fat
.

His
mum
laughing
and
thinking
it
was
cute
is
another
matter
.

sorry
,
just
had
to
get
that
out
.

WOW
Craig
!

The
RYL
in
Yanchep
sounds
very
cool
!

Will
let
ya
know
about
this
very
soon
!!!

I
remember
getting
weighed
in
school
once
,
--
in
form
one
as
they
call
it
in
NZ	B	NZ	New_Zealand	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand	000	000
.

I
had
just
turned
12
then
.

At
that
stage
I
remember
feeling
quite
proud
of
myself
,
--
7
and
a
half
stone
whatever
that
is
in
kilos
,
(
about
48kg
I
think
)
and
157cm
tall
.

I
was
relatively
slim
and
tall
then
for
my
age
.

I
felt
for
the
heavier
kids
though
!

First
time
I
’ve
left
a
comment
only
because
of
what
happened
to
me
.

I
too
was
a
younger
porker
.

First
day
of
year
7
at
an
all
girls
school
we
were
all
lined
up
and
put
on
the
scales
and
they
then
lined
us
up
from
heaviest
(
me
)
to
lightest
.

It
started
a
20
year
problem
with
anorexia
.

I
remember
being
weighed
and
measured
most
years
in
high
school
,
and
doing
a
fitness
test
.

We
never
got
tosee
the
results
.

The
weighing
and
measuring
did
n’t
really
bother
me
as
they
did
it
one
at
a
time
,
and
did
n’t
tell
us
the
results.The
fitness
test
we
didas
a
group
and
I
did
n’t
do
too
well.In
general
I
think
it
is
a
good
idea
.

If
health
indicators
are
getting
worse
,
maybe
schools
will
put
more
emphasis
on
sport
and
helathy
food
in
the
tuckshop
.

My
daughter
just
started
high
school
and
told
me
she
had
the
weigh
in
and
BMI	B	BMI	Body_mass_index	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index	000	000
test
.

As
yet
no
results
have
been
forthcoming
.

I
think
it
is
humiliating
for
the
kids
to
be
put
through
this
.

For
what
purpose
?

If
the
school
would
offer
some
sort
of
help
in
exercise
and
nutrition
for
those
that
need
it
then
fair
enough
.

The
only
thing
I
have
noted
about
PE
at
her
high
school
so
far
is
:

1
)
The
swimming
carnival
--
only
the
fastest
got
to
the
compete
while
the
other
fatties
and
not
so
fit
got
to
sit
all
day
in
the
sun
and
watch
the
beautiful
kids
.

2
)
Sports
Day
--
only
the
best
were
to
compete
--
the
rest
had
to
follow
a
group
of
kids
around
all
day
and
cheer
!

How
is
this
helping
those
that
need
exercise
?

The
kids
were
even
threatened
that
if
they
did
n’t
attend
and
“
cheer
”
their
classmates
on
that
they
would
be
excluded
from
other
excursions
.

This
made
my
blood
boil
!

Who
are
these
people
??

No
wonder
obesity
and
depression
are
rife
in
our
community
.

It

losing

breaking

this
amusing

Findings

The
changes
brought
about
by
the
emergence
and
use
of
technologies
of
cooperation
can
be
analyzed
through
a
matrix
tracking
levels
of
knowledge
on
one
axis
,
and
levels
of
interactivity
of
the
other
axis
.

Levels
of
Interactivity
:

Passive
consumption
:
The
consumer
is
getting
products
or
services
with
no
real
interaction
and
no
real
choice
.

He
has
to
take
whatever
is
available
.

Self
Service
:
The
consumer
is
given
the
ability
to
choose
between
various
products
or
services
.

DIY
:
Do	B	Do It Yourself	Do_it_yourself	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself	000	000
It	I	Do It Yourself	Do_it_yourself	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself	000	000
Yourself	I	Do It Yourself	Do_it_yourself	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself	000	000
:
The
consumer
starts
getting
involved
in
the
value
chain
.

Co-design
:
The
consumer
starts
adding
value
by
customizing
the
product
and
therefore
defining
his
needs
himself
(
as
opposed
to
buying
a
product
defined
by
the
product
management
team
)
.

Co-creation
:
The
consumer
is
involved
in
the
design
of
the
product
or
service
itself
.

Levels
of
knowledge

Raw
Data
:
Data
,
typically
from
measurements
,
or
attributes
(
small
,
big
,
expensive
,
etc.
.

.
)

Information
:
Data
that
I
can
make
sense
of
.

Data
within
a
referential
or
data
that
can
be
tied
to
a
process
,
so
that
I
establish
a
first
level
of
knowledge
.

If
I
can
measure
,
and
if
I
can
compare
,
I
will
be
able
to
develop
a
better
sense
of
understanding

Classification
,
categorization
:
When
I
can
better
define
the
context
,
place
the
information
into
categories

Process/Time
:
When
you
start
introducing
the
concept
of
time
,
and
evolution
over
time
.

Logic
:
When
you
understand
enough
of
a
thing
that
you
can
capture
this
understanding
into
a
logical
model
.

From
this
comes
automation
.

Background
:

The
story
starts
at
a
banker
's
conference
where
Xavier
was
doing
a
presentation
on
e-Banking
.

The
room
suddenly
woke
up
at
the
last
slide
when
he
offered
a
model
to
explain
how
banks
could
move
forward
.

The
impact
was
stunning
,
all
of
a
sudden
everybody
wanted
to
jump
into
the
discussion
.

The
model
was
the
result
of
observations
from
Swissquote
Inc
,
where
intermediaries
had
become
agents
of
change
within
the
company
and
had
help
transform
it
into
a
hyperproductive
company
.

The
model
has
since
then
been
refined
,
with
the
definition
of
the
"
transformActors
"
and
"
ConsumActors
"
,
and
the
classification
of
knowledge
(
inspired
from
Mathematics	B	Mathematics	Mathematics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics	000	000
)
and
interactivity
along
the
2
axis
of
a
matrix
.

The
model
has
also
been
validated
against
3
real
cases
with
3
Swiss	B	Swiss	Switzerland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland	000	000
companies
:
Swissquote
,
Largeur.com
and
Cla-Val
.

The
Model

The
problem
:

low
cost
offshoring
,
baby
boomers
reaching
retirement
age
,
etcâ
$
¦
create
tension
in
the
economy
.

And
the
answer
is
not
in
lowering
costs
,
but
rather
in
achieving
high
productivity
.

The
solution
:

changing
Consumers
into
ConsumActors
.

We
have
heard
of
crowdsourcing
,
but
the
real
underlying
change
is
that
the
customers
are
getting
more
involved
into
the
value
chain
.

Technologies
of
Cooperation

While
technology
helps
improve
processes
,
the
real
value
behind
these
technologies
is
the
shift
in
the
interactivity
between
the
producers
and
the
consumers
:
consumers
are
getting
used
to
getting
more
and
more
involved
into
the
process
(
self
service
,
product
configuration
and
customization
,
etc.
.

.
)

Levels
of
interactivity

The
level
of
interactivity
that
is
possible
with
ConsumActors
can
be
classified
as
follows
:

4.1
Passive
consumption
:

The
consumer
is
getting
products
or
services
with
no
real
interaction
and
no
real
choice
.

He
has
to
take
whatever
is
available
.

4.2
Self
Service

The
consumer
is
now
given
the
ability
to
choose
between
various
products
or
services
.

This
first
step
is
already
a
huge
step
forward
,
as
the
consumer
can
go
around
the
vendor
to
pick
and
choose
what
he
wants
.

4.3
DIY
:
Do
It
Yourself

At
this
level
,
the
consumer
starts
getting
involved
in
the
value
chain
.

This
is
what
IKEA	B	IKEA	IKEA	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA	000	000
offers
,
where
you
are
not
just
buying
a
product
,
you
are
actually
also
delivering
it
to
your
home
and
building
it
yourself
.

This
case
is
an
example
of
the
first
disruption
from
the
standard
retail
value
chain
.

4.4
Co-design

At
this
level
,
the
consumer
starts
adding
value
by
customizing
the
product
and
therefore
defining
his
needs
himself
(
as
opposed
to
buying
a
product
defined
by
the
product
management
team
)
.

This
is
what
Dell	B	Dell	Dell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell	000	000
is
asking
from
customers
when
they
have
to
pick
and
choose
options
to
build
a
computer
.

4.5
Co-creation

This
is
the
ultimate
level
of
involvement
,
where
the
consumer
is
actually
involved
in
the
design
of
the
product
or
service
itself
.

This
is
what
Open	B	Open Source	Open_source	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source	000	000
Source	I	Open Source	Open_source	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source	000	000
does
for
developers
,
and
what
Wikipedia	B	Wikipedia	Wikipedia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia	000	000
does
for
knowledge
consumers
.

Similarly
Procter
and
Gamble	B	Gamble	Gambling	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling	000	000
has
a
"
Connect
and
Develop
"
program
that
lets
innovators
define
products
.

Levels
of
knowledge

Being
able
to
interact
at
the
various
level
listed
above
requires
various
levels
of
access
to
knowledge
.

For
example
co-designing
a
computer
on
the
Dell	B	Dell	Dell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell	000	000
website
implies
that
the
consumer
has
a
good
understanding
of
the
various
components
and
their
importance
within
the
system
.

A
slow
processor
with
lots
of
memory
,
or
a
fast
processor
with
very
little
RAM	B	RAM	Random-access_memory	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory	000	000
are
not
going
to
be
good
options
.

And
then
knowledge
includes
a
notion
of
context
that
should
also
be
taken
into
account
:
knowing
that
something
is
small
is
only
useful
relative
to
a
context
:
is
Jean
small
because
he
is
only
4
years
old
,
or
is
he
small
because
most
people
his
age
are
typically
5
"
tall
?

Following
these
concepts
,
knowledge
can
be
classified
as
follows
:

5.1
Basic
Knowledge

5.1.1
Raw
Data

Data
,
typically
from
measurements
,
or
attributes
(
small
,
big
,
expensive
,
etc.
.

.
)

5.1.2
Information

Information
is
data
that
I
can
make
sense
of
.

Data
within
a
referential
or
data
that
can
be
tied
to
a
process
,
so
that
I
can
establish
a
first
level
of
knowledge
.

If
I
can
measure
,
and
if
I
can
compare
,
I
will
be
able
to
develop
a
sense
of
understanding
:
Jean
is
4
feet
,
and
I
can
measure
his
classmates
to
decide
whether
Jean
is
small
or
not
.

From
information
I
can
develop
basic
knowledge
.

5.2
Formal
knowledge

5.2.1
Classification
,
categorization

This
second
level
of
knowledge
is
when
I
can
better
define
the
context
.

In
the
example
of
Jean
,
I
can
place
the
information
into
categories
to
reach
another
level
of
understanding
:
boy/girl
,
small/tall
.

By
defining
categories
and
sub-categories
,
I
can
refine
the
level
of
knowledge
I
have
.

5.2.2
Process/Time

The
third
level
of
knowledge
is
when
you
start
introducing
the
concept
of
time
,
and
evolution
over
time
.

This
introduces
another
level
of
complexity
and
another
level
of
understanding
beyond
what
can
be
known
now
.

5.2.3
Logic

The
final
level
of
knowledge
is
when
you
understand
enough
of
a
thing
that
you
can
capture
this
understanding
into
a
logical
model
.

From
this
comes
automation
.

This
is
how
we
started
building
calculators
,
encapsulating
logic
into
a
machine
,
and
now
expanding
to
building
transistors
into
microchips
to
build
computers
for
example
.

It
all
seems
as
if
mathematic
algorithms
were
slowly
but
irreversibly
being
materialized
into
automated
processes
.

And
we
are
only
at
the
very
beginning
of
an
exponential
curve
in
this
area
.

5.3
.

Informal
Knowledge

Another
type
of
knowledge
that
will
not
be
considered
in
this
document
,
but
should
be
mentioned
,
is
informal
knowledge
.

5.3.1
Informal
Experience

This
is
knowledge
learned
from
accumulated
experience
.

This
is
how
people
learn
how
to
drive
for
example

5.3.2
Informal
Thinking

This
is
the
knowledge
from
"
soft
"
fields
,
for
example
philosophical
,
cultural
,
religious
,
moral
or
ethical
knowledge
.

They
should
not
be
ignored
since
they
are
at
the
forefront
of
the
political
,
social
and
cultural
scene
.

An
expression
of
this
type
of
knowledge
is
on
display
in
blogs
or
reality
TV
shows
for
example
.

The
management
of
Knowledge
is
what
has
led
to
major
changes
in
the
way
we
work
today
:

It
all
started
with
the
concept
of
“
Community
of
practice
”
presented
by
Etienne
Wenger
on
9/18/88

It
evolved
towards
becoming
a
core
engine
of
the
enterprise
,
with
Knowledge	B	Knowledge Management	Knowledge_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management	000	000
Management	I	Knowledge Management	Knowledge_management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management	000	000
,
to
manage
both
static
(
as
in
encyclopedias
)
and
dynamic
knowledge
(
as
in
knowledge
facilitated
by
groupware
,
starting
with
email
)
.

It
has
also
now
been
opened
and
shared
to
allow
for
collective
intelligence
,
benefiting
both
from
internal
and
external
input
.

The
matrix

Using
the
2
axis
that
were
defined
,
it
is
possible
to
create
a
matrix
that
can
be
used
to
resolve
the
issue
of
transferring
production
from
the
producer
to
the
consumer
.

On
the
vertical
axis
:

Data
-
info
-
classification/categories
-
time
process
-
model

On
the
horizontal
axis
:

Receive
-
Self
Service
-
Do
It
Yourself
-
Co-design
-
Co-creation

To
use
the
matrix
you
need
to
start
from
the
bottom
left
(
data/Receive
)
,
to
then
evolve
towards
the
right
to
include
the
consumer
into
the
value
chain
and
define
the
level
of
knowledge
that
needs
to
be
transferred
to
the
consumer
to
enable
his
involvement
.

The
matrix
can
be
used
for
several
analytical
purposes
:

7.1
Historical
analysis
-
the
matrix
can
be
used
to
compare
the
result
of
2
strategies
used
at
different
times
,
to
analyze
why
one
worked
better
than
the
other
:

Nestle
had
tried
to
sell
Nespresso
through
the
regular
channels
without
much
success
.

Then
they
decided
to
change
strategy
(
break
with
history
)
and
created
the
Club
Nespresso
,
where
customers
are
educated
and
provided
with
a
tool
to
order
directly
online
,
which
completely
change
the
buying
and
consuming
experience

7.2
.

Market
analysis
-
the
matrix
can
be
used
to
compare
the
strategy
of
two
different
companies
on
the
same
market
:

Napster	B	Napster	Napster	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster	000	000
introduced
technology
that
allowed
users
to
download
songs
for
free
.

The
technology
also
allowed
mixing
and
matching
of
songs
so
that
users
could
create
their
own
CDs
.

The
same
concept
was
then
used
by
Apple	B	Apple	Apple_Inc.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.	000	000
to
create
iTune	B	iTune	ITunes	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes	000	000
and
the
iPod	B	iPod	IPod	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod	000	000
,
while
Sony	B	Sony	Sony	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony	000	000
decided
to
simply
extend
its
existing
model
to
make
room
for
this
new
technology
,
but
trying
to
keep
as-is
the
control
of
the
IP
.

The
matrix
shows
that
the
game
was
about
adding
a
level
of
freedom
in
the
consumption
of
songs
,
rather
than
just
extending
technology
.

7.3
Strategic
analysis
-
the
matrix
can
be
used
to
define
where
to
direct
future
developments
:

Telcos
are
being
threatened
by
VOIP
,
which
allows
near
free
communication
anywhere
around
the
world
.

Several
options
are
available
for
them
to
react
:
bundle
services
,
or
offer
new
services
for
mobile
,
where
VOIP
is
not
a
player
today
.

Docomo
is
now
offering
payments
through
mobile
phones
,
thus
starting
to
compete
with
banks
.

The
matrix
can
help
figure
out
which
players
they
should
work
with
to
make
this
strategy
successful

7.4
Positioning
analysis
-
the
matrix
can
help
position
a
product
on
a
market
.

A
computer
is
a
complex
thing
and
I
can
decide
to
buy
through
an
expert
who
will
help
me
design
the
computer
I
need
,
or
I
can
go
to
Dell
to
build
online
my
own
.

The
2
market
segments
can
co-exist
today
,
but
the
matrix
can
help
understand
which
market
will
survive
in
the
long
term

Case
studies

8.1
Swissquote
(
a
Swiss
equivalent
of
eTrade
)

From
the
CEO
prospective
,
the
success
of
Swissquote
is
due
to
:

Empowerment
:
providing
the
right
information
and
tools
to
customers
to
allow
them
to
trade
online

Monitoring
:
performing
statistical
analysis
to
evaluate
risk
,
as
a
tool
for
both
the
bank
and
the
users

E-wealth
management
:
tools
to
help
users
optimize
their
investments

One
challenge
was
and
still
is
the
education
of
customers
.

2
types
of
classes
are
offered
:
first
step
(
free
)
,
and
paying
classes
on
specific
topics
.

This
is
a
very
costly
undertaking
,
a
risk
taken
to
help
the
transformation

The
other
challenge
is
to
provide
the
right
tools
,
allowing
to
perform
complex
operations
while
remaining
user
friendly
.

This
challenge
still
needs
to
be
addressed
today
.

Looking
at
the
banking
industry
,
there
are
2
major
trends
that
can
be
identified
:

Communities
of
practice
are
taking
over
the
education
of
consumers
and
improved
interactions

Models
need
to
be
improved
to
help
provide
more
sophisticated
tools

The
matrix
can
help
clarify
these
trends
and
challenges

8.2
Largeur.com
-
citizen
journalism

After
several
experiments
,
Largeur.com
has
settled
for
a
model
where
they
produce
high
quality
journalism
but
getting
the
content
from
freelancers
and
offering
aggressive
prices
.

Once
the
customer
base
was
established
,
they
looked
into
opening
the
platform
to
students
and
other
members
of
the
civil
society
(
teachers
,
thought
leaders
but
also
unemployed
people
)
,
which
are
representative
of
the
audience
they
are
addressing
already
.

The
media
industry
is
organized
around
3
major
poles
:

Convergence
(
synergy
between
traditional
media
and
the
Internet
)
-
Financial
Times
,
Wall
Street
Journal

Divergence
(
break
from
the
traditional
model
to
go
towards
a
crowdsourcing
approach
)
-
OhMyNews

Complementarities
(
compromise
between
the
other
two
)
-
TSR.ch

The
matrix
can
help
rationalize
the
various
content
production
and
content
delivery
tools
(
blogs
,
RSS
,
Web
,
SMS/MMS
,
and
Newspapers
)
to
better
understand
the
media
industry

8.3
Cla-Val
-
pumps
to
regulate
pressure

They
have
evolved
around
4
major
poles
:

Commoditization
:
they
have
accumulated
over
the
years
more
than
100
standard
products

Customization
:
their
customers
can
not
get
an
end
to
end
solution
from
just
the
standard
products

Geographical
expansion
:
the
experience
gained
in
the
implementation
of
custom
solutions
opens
new
geographical
markets
and
allows
rapid
expansion

Customer
innovation
:
customization
has
also
introduced
flexibility
into
the
system
,
and
combined
with
remote
management
capabilities
has
enabled
co-innovation

The
matrix
clearly
shows
how
this
evolution
was
possible
.

Conclusion

Direct
economy
is
the
result
of
5
major
factors
:

Introduction
of
the
consumer
into
the
value
chain

Death
of
the
old
intermediaries
,
to
leave
room
for
new
types
of
interactions

Empowerment
of
ordinary
people
to
include
them
in
the
innovation
process
,
which
creates
the
issue
of
Intellectual
Property
and
how
to
handle
it

Emergence
of
new
business
models
that
threaten
the
existing
monopolies

Emergence
of
new
pricing
models
:
donations
(
OhMyNews
)
or
Bidding	B	Bidding	Bidding	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidding	000	000
(
EBay	B	EBay	EBay	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay	000	000
)
.

IKEA	B	IKEA	IKEA	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA	000	000
,
Easyjet	B	Easyjet	EasyJet	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyJet	000	000
,
Dell	B	Dell	Dell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell	000	000
,
Nokia	B	Nokia	Nokia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia	000	000
,
L'Oreal
,
Procter
&
Gamble
,
Swissquote
are
examples
of
the
transformations
that
can
be
implemented
.

Companies
have
to
move
towards
hypergrowth
to
survive
.

What
is
interesting
is
that
new
sub-categories
of
products
are
being
created
in
the
process
(
song
vs.
album
)
,
that
banks
and
credit
cards
were
not
setup
to
handle
originally
.

Hel
looks
and
The
Satorialist
are
examples
of
what
is
happening
in
the
fashion
industry
.

Istockphoto
,
Innocentive	B	Innocentive	InnoCentive	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InnoCentive	000	000
or
Marketocracy
are
example
of
consumer
involvement
in
the
value
chain
.

In
conclusion
,
is
n't
it
that
the
changes
we
are
witnessing
in
the
economy
are
similar
to
what
happened
with
Direct	B	Direct Democracy	Direct_democracy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy	000	000
Democracy	I	Direct Democracy	Direct_democracy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy	000	000
in
Switzerland	B	Switzerland	Switzerland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland	000	000
?

The
consumers
have
been
empowered
,
and
are
we
not
slowly
evolving
towards
a
Direct
Economy
,
completely
changing
the
underlying
principles
of
the
Global	B	Global Economy	World_economy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy	000	000
Economy	I	Global Economy	World_economy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy	000	000
as
we
know
it
today
?

Epilogue

While
Switzerland	B	Switzerland	Switzerland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland	000	000
introduced
Direct	B	Direct Democracy	Direct_democracy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy	000	000
Democracy	I	Direct Democracy	Direct_democracy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy	000	000
,
they
are
now
lagging
in
their
e-government
implementation
effort
.

The
matrix
can
help
understand
what
is
happening
and
what
needs
to
be
done
.

It
can
help
compare
what
is
available
today
against
what
others
in

.

I
do
n’t
follow
sports
but
he
’s
been
in
too
many
news
headlines
lately
to
be
overlooked
.

Reportedly
he
’s
not
a
very
good
athlete
but
he
won
6
out
of
the
7
matches
in
which
he
played
so
far
.

He
would
give
all
credits
to
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
and
that
’s
when
the
controversies
started
.

Tebow	B	Tebow	Tim_Tebow	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow	000	000
is
the
son
of
a
Pastor
and
a
devout
Christian	B	Christian	Christian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian	000	000
.

He
would
go
down
on
one
knee
and
bow
his
head
to
pray
before
the
arena
throng
after
each
touchdown
.

Naturally
this
pose
of
a
6
’
3
”
prominently
built
athlete
stirred
admiration
and
criticism
at
the
same
time
.

People
all
over
the
world
are
posting
on
web
pages
pictures
of
themselves
posing
like
Tebow	B	Tebow	Tim_Tebow	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow	000	000
.

There
’re
web
sites
dedicated
to
Tebowing
,
as
they
’d
call
it
.

However
,
it
’s
the
even
more
feverish
criticisms
that
brought
Tim	B	Tim Tebow	Tim_Tebow	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow	000	000
Tebow	I	Tim Tebow	Tim_Tebow	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow	000	000
to
my
attention
.

Critics
are
disturbed
by
his
open
proclamation
of
his
Christianity	B	Christianity	Christianity	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity	000	000
and
celibacy
before
marriage
.

A
columnist
on
Jewish
Weekly
posted
a
message
that
said
a
Super	B	Super Bowl	Super_Bowl	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl	000	000
Bowl	I	Super Bowl	Super_Bowl	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl	000	000
victory
by
the
Evangelical
Christian
Quarterback
could
incite
others
to
burn
mosques
,
bash
gays
and
banish
immigrants
.

The
columnist
is
a
highly
respected
Jewish
leader
Rabbi
Joshua
Hammerman
.

I
must
say
his
imagination
knows
no
bound
.

Not
in
my
wildest
dreams
would
evangelical
Christians	B	Christians	Christian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian	000	000
burn
mosques
.

Many
Jews	B	Jews	Jews	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews	000	000
came
to
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
after
World	B	World War II	World_War_II	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II	000	000
War	I	World War II	World_War_II	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II	000	000
II	I	World War II	World_War_II	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II	000	000
because
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
was
a
free
country
.

They
can
safely
practice
Judaism	B	Judaism	Judaism	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism	000	000
here
and
should
respect
that
Christians	B	Christians	Christian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian	000	000
have
the
right
to
practice
Christianity	B	Christianity	Christianity	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity	000	000
also
.

You
just
ca
n’t
mistake
a
Jew	B	Jew	Jews	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews	000	000
just
because
of
their
unique
attire
.

Then
why
would
it
be
an
issue
when
Christians	B	Christians	Christian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian	000	000
proclaim
what
they
are
?

Tebow	B	Tebow	Tim_Tebow	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow	000	000
has
not
done
any
more
than
expressing
his
identity
.

He
did
n’t
pray
aloud
.

He
did
n’t
give
a
sermon
.

If
stating
his
religion
is
enough
to
disturb
you
,
do
you
also
find
the
long
coats
of
Jews	B	Jews	Jews	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews	000	000
and
turbans
of
Muslims	B	Muslims	Muslim	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim	000	000
in
the
summer
heat
disturbing
?

As
far
as
gays
are
concerned
,
it
’s
clearly
stated
in
the
bible
that
homosexuality
is
a
sin
,
and
any
Christians	B	Christians	Christian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian	000	000
would
say
it
as
it
is
regardless
of
Tim	B	Tim Tebow	Tim_Tebow	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow	000	000
Tebow	I	Tim Tebow	Tim_Tebow	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow	000	000
.

At
least
Christians	B	Christians	Christian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian	000	000
would
not
take
it
upon
themselves
to
punish
sinners
.

Regarding
immigrants
,
I
believe
many
Christians	B	Christians	Christian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian	000	000
are
immigrants
themselves
and
why
would
they
banish
immigrants
?

Rabbi
Hammerman
apologized
about
his
posting
later
but
it
’s
like
asking
the
jurors
to
ignore
an
attorney
’s
baseless
accusations
after
it
’s
been
deliberated
in
the
court
.

Is
it
possible
?

Jews
live
in
their
own
communities
,
study
at
their
own
schools
and
ignore
public
media
.

With
such
a
biased
religious
leader
,
the
biased
views
will
only
accentuate
themselves
.

Rabbi
Hammerman
was
n’t
the
only
biased
critic
.

The
former
Broncos	B	Broncos	Denver_Broncos	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos	000	000
quarterback
Jake	B	Jake Plummer	Jake_Plummer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Plummer	000	000
Plummer	I	Jake Plummer	Jake_Plummer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Plummer	000	000
also
said
that
he
wished
Tebow	B	Tebow	Tim_Tebow	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow	000	000
would
keep
quiet
about
his
religion
.

Riverhead
High
School
in
Long	B	Long Island	Long_Island	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island	000	000
Island	I	Long Island	Long_Island	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island	000	000
recently
suspended
two
student
athletes
for
a
day
for
Tebowing
in
the
corridor
.

The
school
denied
that
the
suspension
was
motivated
by
religion
.

They
said
it
was
dangerous
when
students
gathered
to
watch
.

When
I
was
in
high
school
,
I
’d
seen
much
worse
than
several
kneeling
boys
.

That
’s
a
pretty
lame
excuse
.

There
’re
students
who
dress
weirdly
like
pop
icons
such
as
Lady	B	Lady Gaga	Lady_Gaga	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga	000	000
Gaga	I	Lady Gaga	Lady_Gaga	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga	000	000
and
you
do
n’t
see
any
suspension
because
of
that
.

Now
a
few
boys
were
imitating
an
athlete
with
some
moral
conviction
,
one
who
vowed
to
abstain
from
pre-marital
sex
,
and
they
got
disciplined
.

What
’s
happening
?

A
few
months
ago
,
the
announcement
of
a
retired
football
player
about
his
homosexuality
was
met
with
standing
ovation
nationwide
.

He
was
seen
as
a
hero
.

Now
a
young
football
star
proclaims
his
Christianity	B	Christianity	Christianity	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity	000	000
and
he
is
met
with
hostility
.

In
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
,
you
can
openly
talk
about
your
sexual
orientation
,
plastic
surgery
and
adultery
.

You
can
divorce
your
spouse
after
72
days
of
marriage
and
still
remain
highly
popular
.

Nothing
incites
as
much
insult
as
being
Christian	B	Christian	Christian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian	000	000
.

The
military
rule
Do	B	Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell	Don't_ask,_don't_tell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_ask,_don't_tell	000	000
n't	I	Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell	Don't_ask,_don't_tell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_ask,_don't_tell	000	000

Tell	I	Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell	Don't_ask,_don't_tell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_ask,_don't_tell	000	000
has
been
abolished
after
Obama	B	Obama	Barack_Obama	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama	000	000
became
the
president
.

That
rule
no
longer
applies
to
gays
in
the
military
.

I
have
a
feeling
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
are
trying
to
enforce
the
Do	B	Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell	Don't_ask,_don't_tell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_ask,_don't_tell	000	000

The
one
thing
Willie	B	Willie Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
Taggart	I	Willie Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
has
learned
since
becoming
a
head
football
coach
is
that
there
is
no
down
time.Since
he
took
over
at
Western	B	Western Kentucky	Western_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kentucky	000	000
Kentucky	I	Western Kentucky	Western_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kentucky	000	000
,
Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
has
been
busier
than
a
politician
just
before
election
day
.

He
is
one
of
the
most
sought
after
speakers
in
a
state
that
already
has
Rick
Pinto
and
John	B	John Calipari	John_Calipari	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calipari	000	000
Calipari	I	John Calipari	John_Calipari	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calipari	000	000
and
next
month
he
has
a
dinner
engagement
with
the
governor.That
’s
a
big
step
up
for
an
8-year-old
kid
who
spent
a
good
part
of
his
youth
working
in
the
Palmetto	B	Palmetto	Palmetto,_Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmetto,_Florida	000	000
orange
groves
.

“
Picking
oranges
taught
me
what
I
did
n’t
want
to
do
and
that
football
was
my
way
out
.

I
had
to
be
the
best
player
and
to
do
that
I
had
to
out-work
everyone
,
”
he
says
.

Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
has
yet
to
coach
a
game
since
he
was
hired
last
November
to
turn
around
a
Western	B	Western Kentucky	Western_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kentucky	000	000
Kentucky	I	Western Kentucky	Western_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kentucky	000	000
football
program
that
has
lost
20
straight
games.But
that
does
n’t
mean
the
former
Manatee
High
quarterback
has
n’t
been
competing
and
testing
himself
.

“
I
’ve
done
more
speaking
engagements
since
I
’ve
been
here
than
I
did
in
my
entire
life
,
”
Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
says
.

“
At
first
it
was
hard
,
and
I
had
to
work
on
it
.

I
am
a
lot
better
at
it
now
and
a
lot
more
comfortable
.

I
learned
how
to
present
myself
in
the
best
way
and
realized
I
do
n’t
have
to
speak
so
fast
or
be
afraid
.
”

History
is
also
not
lost
on
Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
,
who
appears
on
the
verge
of
becoming
a
rising
star
in
the
college
football
coaching
ranks.This
fall
Kentucky	B	Kentucky	Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky	000	000
will
become
the
first
and
only
state
in
the
country
to
have
three
black
head
football
coaches
at
its
three
major
(
FBS	B	FBS	Division_I_(NCAA)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)	000	000
)
colleges
with
Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
,
Charlie	B	Charlie Strong	Charlie_Strong	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Strong	000	000
Strong	I	Charlie Strong	Charlie_Strong	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Strong	000	000
at
Louisville	B	Louisville	Louisville_Cardinals	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Cardinals	000	000
and
Joker	B	Joker Phillips	Joker_Phillips	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_Phillips	000	000
Phillips	I	Joker Phillips	Joker_Phillips	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_Phillips	000	000
at
Kentucky	B	Kentucky	Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky	000	000
.

It
is
the
first
head
coaching
job
for
all
three
,
but
at
34
,
Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
made
it
up
the
ladder
a
lot
quicker
than
the
47-year-old
Phillips	B	Phillips	Joker_Phillips	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_Phillips	000	000
and
Strong	B	Strong	Charlie_Strong	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Strong	000	000
(
49
)
.

“
We
talk
.

A
lot
of
it
is
about
where
we
are
in
our
programs
and
life
in
general
and
not
that
much
football
.

Right
now
Joker	B	Joker	Joker_Phillips	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_Phillips	000	000
is
not
going
to
say
a
lot
because
we
play
each
other
,
”
he
says
.

It
has
helped
that
Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
was
a
star
quarterback
for
the
Hilltoppers
from
1995-98
and
is
considered
the
best
football
player
WKU	B	WKU	Western_Kentucky_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kentucky_University	000	000
has
ever
produced.The
difference
is
that
the
WKU	B	WKU	Western_Kentucky_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kentucky_University	000	000
of
today
is
headed
into
its
third
year
as
a
Division	B	Division IA	Division_I_(NCAA)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)	000	000
IA	I	Division IA	Division_I_(NCAA)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I_(NCAA)	000	000
program
and
has
n’t
had
any
success
since
moving
up
.

It
does
n’t
bother
Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
.

When
he
sees
insurmountable
odds
,
he
remembers
his
days
of
picking
oranges
with
his
four
siblings
,
mom
and
dad
.

They
all
had
to
chip
in
to
pay
the
rent
and
put
food
on
the
table
.

“
I
have
been
working
hard
all
my
life
,
and
it
has
gotten
me
here
.

But
we
want
to
go
further
,
”
Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
says
.

“
The
enthusiasm
and
excitement
I
have
received
around
the
state
has
surprised
me
.

I
’ve
always
wanted
to
be
the
best
and
tell
our
football
team
we
are
going
to
chase
greatness
.
”

Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
caught
it
as
a
player
guiding
Manatee	B	Manatee	Manatee_County,_Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manatee_County,_Florida	000	000
to
a
state
championship
and
becoming
one
of
only
four
players
to
have
his
number
retired
at
WKU	B	WKU	Western_Kentucky_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kentucky_University	000	000
after
a
record
setting
career
.

He
spent
the
past
three
seasons
at
Stanford	B	Stanford	Stanford_Cardinal_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_Cardinal_football	000	000
helping
Jim	B	Jim Harbaugh	Jim_Harbaugh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh	000	000
Harbaugh	I	Jim Harbaugh	Jim_Harbaugh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh	000	000
turn
that
program
around.The
WKU	B	WKU	Western_Kentucky_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kentucky_University	000	000
football
program
could
n’t
be
any
lower
,
which
is
one
reason
many
considered
Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
the
best
person
for
the
job
.

Until
his
junior
year
at
Manatee
High
,
he
and
his
parents
and
four
other
siblings
lived
in
a
three
room
apartment
,
an
environment
he
feels
prepared
him
to
succeed
.

“
That
is
where
it
all
started
for
me
,
and
every
time
I
come
to
Manatee	B	Manatee County	Manatee_County,_Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manatee_County,_Florida	000	000
County	I	Manatee County	Manatee_County,_Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manatee_County,_Florida	000	000
to
recruit
I
go
back
there
,
”
he
says
.

“
It
motivates
me
and
reminds
me
that
I
have
not
changed
who
I
am
because
I
am
a
head
football
coach
at
a
university
.

I
do
n’t
want
to
try
and
be
anybody
else
because
then
I
will
not
succeed
.
”

With
no
head
coaching
experience
,
some
have
questioned
Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
about
how
he
is
going
to
turn
around
a
program
that
is
a
doormat
.

Those
questions
do
not
frighten
him
,
and
this
year
he
had
the
No.
1
rated
recruiting
class
in
the
Sun	B	Sun Belt Conference	Sun_Belt_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference	000	000
Belt	I	Sun Belt Conference	Sun_Belt_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference	000	000
Conference	I	Sun Belt Conference	Sun_Belt_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference	000	000
.

“
I
tell
them
I
have
no
evidence
that
I
can
win
,
but
have
faith
in
me
,
”
Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
says
.

“
Everywhere
I
have
been
as
an
assistant
coach
and
a
player
I
have
won
.

I
tell
them
they
have
a
chance
to
be
part
of
something
special
and
that
I
am
recruiting
you
to
come
in
and
take
somebody
’s
job
.

That
is
the
environment
we
are
going
to
have
around
here
.
”

Taggart	B	Taggart	Willie_Taggart	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Taggart	000	000
has
recruited
heavily
in
Manatee	B	Manatee County	Manatee_County,_Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manatee_County,_Florida	000	000
County	I	Manatee County	Manatee_County,_Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manatee_County,_Florida	000	000
,
leaving
the
belief
that
he
is
trying
to
help
those
who
grew
up
in
an
environment
similar
to
him
.

He
says
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
.

“
We
are
not
offering
them
scholarships
to
show
love
.

We
are
offering
guys
to
come
here
and
win
football
games
.

I
know
there
are
really
good
football
players
there
,

show
that
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
wind
resources
are
significantly
greater
than
previously
estimated
.

Onshore
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
wind
resources
could
generate
nearly
37,000,000
gigawatt-hours
(
GWh
)
annually
,
more
than
nine
times
current
total
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
electricity
consumption
,
according
to
analysis
by

.

The
previous
national
government
survey
of
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
wind
resources
,
carried
out
by
the
Pacific
Northwest
Laboratory
,
estimated
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
wind
potential
at
10,777,000
GWh
.

Put
another
way
,
the
potential
capacity
of
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
’s
onshore
wind
resource
is
over
10,000
gigawatts
(
GW
)
.

The
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
is
barely
tapping
this
vast
resource
:
current
wind
installed
capacity
is
35
GW
in
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
and
158
GW
world-wide
.

These
larger
estimates
are
due
to
improved
wind
turbine
technology
,
as
today
’s
taller
turbines
tap
better
winds
at
higher
elevations
(
this
study
measured
winds
at
80
meters
)
,
and
to
more
refined
wind
measurements
.

moved
up
into
the
list
of
the
top
20
windiest
states
.

In
a
single
year
,
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
wind
resource
potential
could
produce
364.9

reserves
in

And
,
of
course
,
as
a
renewable
resource
,
wind
will
not
be
depleted
and
will
continue
to
provide
energy
year

Integrable
Teichmuller
spaces

We
introduce
a
new
kind
of
subspaces
of
the
universal

Teichmuller
space
.

Some
characterizations
of
them
are
given
in
terms

of
univalent
functions
,
Beltrami
coefficients
and
quasisymmetric

homeomorphisms
of
the
boundary
of
the
unit
disc
.

Teichmuller
contraction
and
renormalization

According
to
Royden-Gardiner
theorem
,
any
holomorphic

mapping
between
Teichmuller
spaces
does
not
expand
the
Teichmuller

distance
.

(
Just
like
Schwarz-Pick
theorem
says
that
any
holomorphic

mapping
between
hyperbolic
Riemann	B	Riemann	Bernhard_Riemann	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann	000	000
surfaces
does
not
expand
the

Poincare
metric
.
)

In
the
theory
of
renormalizations
,
one
often
wants

to
show
that
the
renormalization
map
(
which
is
defined
in
a
transcendental

way
)
on
the
space
of
certain
dynamical
systems
is
hyperbolic
or

contracting
.

Therefore
Royden-Gardiner
theorem
is
an
obvious

candidate
of
tools
to
obtain
the
contraction
.

This
idea
was
first

used
by
Sullivan
in
his
work
on
generalized
Feigenbaum
type
renormalization
.

In
this
talk
,
we
will
discuss
two
applications
of
Teichmuller

theory
to
renormalizations
:

1
.

Parabolic
renormalization
for
parabolic
fixed

points
and
their
perturbations
.

2
.

Rigidity
of
real
quadratic

polynomials
only
using
Yoccoz
's
combinatorial
a
priori
bounds
.

For
these
cases
,
we
deal
with
the
Teichmuller

spaces
of
a
disk
or
a
punctured
disk
and
show
that
a
certain
inclusion

map
induces
a
contraction
in
Teichmuller
distance
.

The
complex
a
priori
bounds
,
continued

We
describe
how
to
reduce
the
a
priori
bounds
for

bounded-primitive
type
renormalization
to
a
simple
combinatorial

statement
regarding
the
combinatorial
dynamics
of
arcs
.

We
show

how
the
combinatorial
statement
follows
from
the
expanding
dynamics

on
the
Hubbard	B	Hubbard	John_H._Hubbard	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Hubbard	000	000

A
fundamental
domain
for
V
_
{
3
}
.

Abstract	B	Abstract	Abstract_(summary)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary)	000	000
:
We
consider
the
space
V
_
{
n
}
of
quadratic

rational
maps
with
one
named
critical
point
of
period
n
,
quotiented

by
M	B	M	Metre	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre	000	000
\
"
obius
conjugacy
preserving
named
critical
points
.

Thus
,

the
space
V
_
{
1
}
is
the
space
of
all
quadratic
polynomials
up
to

affine
conjugacy
.

The
parameter
space
V
_
{
1
}
must
be
one
of
the
most

studied
in
all
dynamics
.

But
V
_
{
1
}
differs
from
most
other
parameter

spaces
in
an
important
respect
:
there
is
a
natural
``
base
map
''

and
,
within
the
Mandelbrot
set
,
natural
paths
,
up
to
a
natural
homotopy
,

to
any
other
map
in
the
Mandelbrot
set
.

The
simplest
parameter
space

for
which
this
fails
to
be
true
is
V
_
{
3
}
.

One
can
say
(
truthfully
)
that
there
is
no
canonical

choice
of
fundamental
domain
for
V
_
{
3
,
m
}
,
which
is
obtained
from

V
_
{
3
}
by
removing
a
natural
dynamically
defined
puncture
set
.

I
shall
exhibit
a
fundamental
domain
,
using
the
dynamical
planes

of
three
maps
within
V
_
{
3
}
and
a
theory
known
as
the
``
Resident
's

View
''
.

This
enables
one
to
at
least
formulate
an
analogue
of

MLC	B	MLC	Multi-level_cell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-level_cell	000	000
for
this
family
.

Three
parts
of
the
fundamental
domain
are
straightforward

(
although
the
proof
in
one
of
these
cases
is
probably
new
)
.

The

structure
of
the
fourth
part
is
much
more
interesting
,
involving

a
spiral
in
the
dynamical
plane
of
the
so-called
``
aeroplane
''

quadratic
polynomial
z
\
mapsto
z
^
{

}
+
c
for
the
(
unique
)
real
parameter

c
for
which
the
critical
point
0
has
period
3
.

laminations

We
will
consider
laminations
by
hyperbolic
Riemann

surfaces
,
and
different

measures
that
can
be
associated
with
these
objects
(
holonomy-invariant

measures
,
harmonic
measures
,
measures
invariant
under
the
geodesic

and

horocycle
flows
)
.

We
will
state
some
results
that
show
how
these

measures

are

.

We
will
mainly
focus
on
two
families
of
examples
:
Riccati

foliations

Newton
's
Method
in
two
complex
variables
:
Indeterminant
points

and
the
topology
of
basins
of
attraction

The
equations
x
(
x-1
)
=
0
,
y
^
2
+
Bxy-y
=
0
are
easy

to
solve
,
but
the
Newton
Map

N
:
C
^
2
\
rightarrow
C
^
2
for
finding
the
four
roots
has
very
complicated

dynamics
:
N
is
four-to-one
and
N
has
points
of
indeterminacy
.

Furthermore
,
high
iterates
of
N
have
many
points
of
indeterminacy
.

By
restricting
to
parameters
|
1-B
|
>
1
,
all
of
these
points
of

indeterminacy
are
in
the
set
X_l
=
Re
(
x
)
<
1/2
,
which
is
invariant

under
N
.

If
one
wants
to
consider
the
homotopy
type
of
a
basin

of
attraction
,
W	B	W	Watt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt	000	000
(
r_i
)
,
for
one
of
the
roots
r_i
\
in
X_l
under

N
,
one
encounters
a
kind
of
``
topological
indeterminacy
.
''

When

studying
the
homotopy
type
of
a
loop
\
gamma
in
W	B	W	Watt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt	000	000
(
r_i
)
,
should

one
consider
the
homotopies
that
hit
the
points
of
indeterminacy

of
N
^
k
or
should
one
avoid
them
?

Both
seem
reasonable
.

To
avoid

such
questions
,
one
can
perform
blow-ups
at
the
points
of
indeterminacy

of
all
iterates
of
N
,
obtaining
a
new
space
X_l
^
\
infty
from
X_l

on
which
all
iterates
of
N
are
defined
.

We
show
how
to
make
precise
the
notion
of
linking

numbers
in
X_l
^
\
infty
,
overcoming
a
different
kind
of
indeterminacy

that
is
a
result
of
the
fact
that
H_2
(
X_l
^
\
infty
)
is
infinitely

generated
.

Having
developed
this
technology
,
I
will
explain
how

we
can
use
it
to
study
the
homotopy
type
of
the
basins
of
attraction

W	B	W	Watt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt	000	000

Holomorphic
endomorphisms
of

spaces

Abstract
:
The
most
traditional
configuration
space

C
(

of
a
complex
space
X
consists
of
all
n
point
subsets
(
"
configurations
"
)

Q	B	Q	Q_factor	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor	000	000
in
X
.

If
X
carries
an
additional
geometric
structure
,
it
may
be
taken

into
account
;
say
if
X
=
CP
^
m
or
C
^
m
,
the
space
C
(

of

configurations
Q	B	Q	Q_factor	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor	000	000

such
that
no
hyperplane
in
X
contains
more
than
m
points
of
Q
.

An

automorphism
T
of
X
(
preserving
an
additional
geometric
structure
,

whenever
it
is
relevant
)
produces
a
holomorphic
endomorphism
f
of

the
configuration
space
via
f
(
Q	B	Q	Q_factor	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor	000	000
)
=
TQ
.

If
the
automorphism
group
Aut

X
is
a
complex
Lie
group
,
one
may
take
T
=
T	B	T	Q_factor	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor	000	000
(
Q	B	Q	Q_factor	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor	000	000
)
depending
analytically

on
a
configuration
Q
and
define
the
corresponding
holomorphic
endomorphism

f
by
f
(
Q	B	Q	Q_factor	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor	000	000
)
=
T
(
Q	B	Q	Q_factor	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor	000	000
)
Q
.

Such
a
map
f
is
called
tame
.

In
the
talk
,
we
shall

see
that
for
every
non-hyperbolic
Riemann
surface
X
all
"
non-degenerate

holomorphic
endomorphisms
of

C
(

To

this

The

of

a

is

involved

Anisotropic

Abstract
:
(
Joint

)
The
Ruelle

transfer
operator
is
a
powerful
tool
in
ergodic
theory
,
which
involves

composition
with
the
dynamics
.

Many
relevant
dynamical
systems
are

hyperbolic
,
i.e.
they
involve
contracting
and
expanding
directions
.

Composition
with
a
contraction

improves
regularity
-
but
composing
with
an
expanding
map
"
worsens
"

regularity
:
It
has
been
an
open

for

to
find
a

of

on
which
composition
by
a

can

Last

we
constructed

such

estimated
the

there
exists
a

In

Henon
renormalization
(
I
)

Abstract	B	Abstract	Abstract_(summary)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary)	000	000
:
This
mini-course
will
introduce
a
renormalization

operator
for
dissipative
Henon-like
maps
.

The
fixed
point
of
the

one-dimensional
renormalization
operator
will
also
be
a
hyperbolic

fixed
point
of
the
Henon-renormalization
operator
.

This
corresponds

to
universal
geometrical
properties
of
the
Cantor	B	Cantor	Georg_Cantor	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor	000	000
attractor
of
infinitely

renormalizable
Henon-like
maps
.

However
,
the
two-dimensional
theory

is
richer
than
the
unimodal
case
.

In
particular
,
the
Cantor	B	Cantor	Georg_Cantor	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor	000	000
attractor

is
not
rigid
,
does
not
lie
on
a
smooth
curve
and
generically
does

not
have
bounded
geometry
.

The
quantitative
aspects
of
these
phenomena

are
controlled
by
the
average
Jacobian	B	Jacobian	Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant	000	000
.

The
global
topological
properties
of
finitely
renormalizable
Henon-like

maps
in
phase
and
parameter
space
are
also
controlled
by
the
average

Jacobian	B	Jacobian	Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant	000	000
.

In
particular
,
density
of
hyperbolicity
will
be
discussed

in
a
neighborhood
of
the
infinitely
renormalizable
maps
.

Renormalization
of
vector
fields
(
I
)

Abstract	B	Abstract	Abstract_(summary)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary)	000	000
:
This
mini-course
covers
some
of
the
recent

developments
in
the
renormalization
of
flows
-
mainly
Hamiltonian	B	Hamiltonian	Hamiltonian_mechanics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics	000	000

flows
and
skew
flows
.

After
stating
some
of
the
problems
and
describing

alternative
approaches
,
we
focus
on
the
definition
and
basic
properties

of
a
single
renormalization
step
.

A
second
part
deals
with
the
construction

of
conjugacies
and
invariant
tori
,
including
shearless
tori
,
and

non-differentiable
tori
for
critical
Hamiltonians
.

Then
we
discuss

properties
related
to
the
spectrum
of
the
linearized
renormalization

transformation
,
such
as
the
accumulation
rates
for
sequences
of

closed
orbits
.

The
last
part
describes
extensions
from
"
simple
"

to
Diophantine	B	Diophantine	Diophantine_equation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diophantine_equation	000	000
rotation
vectors
.

This
involves
sequences
of
renormalization

transformations
that
are
related
to
continued
fractions
expansions

in
one
and
more
dimensions
.

Whenever
appropriate
,
the
discussion

of
details
will
be
restricted
to
special
cases
where
inessential

technical
complications
can
be
avoided
.

Lower
bounds
for
the
entropy
in
several
families
of
dynamical

systems

Abstract
:
Using
soft
techniques
we
prove
lower
bounds

for
the
maximum
entropy
of
a
system
in
a
family
in
terms
of
the

entropy
of
a
random
product
of
the
systems
in
the
family
.

We
accomplish

this
for
two
families
of
immersions
of
the
circle
.

For
one
family

this
is
joint
work
with
Leonel
Robert
and
Enrique
Pujals
and
the

other
Rafael
de
la
Llave
and
Carles

.

Time
permitting
we
recall

a
two
dimensional
analog
whose
entropy
properties
are
still
unknown
,

but
for
which
partial

results
have
been
achieved
in

Super-stable
manifolds
for
Newton
's
methods
in
two
complex

variables

Abstract	B	Abstract	Abstract_(summary)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary)	000	000
:
While
the
equations
x
(
x-1
)
=
0
,
y
^
2
+
Bxy-y
=
0

are
easy
to
solve
,
the
dynamics
of
the
Newton
map
N
(
x
,
y
)
for
finding

the
four
roots
is
quite
complicated
.

In
particular
,
N
is
many-to-one

and
N
has
points
of
indeterminacy
.

The
two
vertical
lines
x
=
0
and
x
=
1
are
invariant
under
N
and
super-attracting
.

Within
these
lines
the
''
circles
''
Re
(
y
)
=
1/2
and
Re
(
y
)
=
(
1-B
)
/
2
,

respectively
,
are
hyperbolically
repelling
with
multiplier
2
.

In
this
talk
we
will
prove
that
these
circles
have
superstable

manifolds
of
real
dimension
3
using
the
technique
of
holomorphic

motions
.

These
manifolds
extend
to
all
points
with
Re
(
x
)
<

1/2
and
Re
(
x
)
>
1/2
respectively
and
provide
insight
into
the

topology
of
the
basins
of
attraction
for
the
four
roots
.

Renormalization
for
irrationally
indifferent
fixed
points
of

holomorphic
maps

Abstract	B	Abstract	Abstract_(summary)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_(summary)	000	000
:
Indifferent
fixed
points
of
holomorphic

maps
give
rise
to
delicate
problems
such
as
linearization
problems
,

discontinuous
Julia	B	Julia	Julia_set	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set	000	000
sets
etc.
.

In
this
talk
,
we
review
the
study

of
those
phenomena
from
the
renormalization
point
of
view
.

We

define
a
certain
class
of
holomorphic
maps
with
"
non-degenerate
"

parabolic
fixed
points
.

The
parabolic
renormalizaion
is
defined

for
this
class
and
shown
to
leave
the
class
invariant
.

Then
the

class
is
still
invariant
under
a
small
perturbation
,
therefore

we
can
handle
irrationally
indifferent
fixed
points
with
large

continued
fraction
coefficients
.

This
is
a
joint
work
with
Hiroyuki

Inou
.

We
will
compare
this
approach
with
Yoccoz
's
and
McMullen
's
renormalizations
.

We
will
also
mention
possible
applications
such
as
Buff-Cheritat
's

work
toward
positive
measure

How
to
Start
a
Business
While
Avoiding
Nasty
Surprises

Posted

Sarah
on
Tuesday

2012

There
are
two
extremes
to
starting
a
business
:
carefully
considering
your
situation
and
best
steps
forward
,
or
throwing
caution
to
the
wind
and
jumping
in
with
both
feet
.

Most
businesses
start
with
a
combination
of
both
philosophies
--
it
’s
important
to
avoid
paralysis
by
analysis
,
forever
accumulating
information
and
failing
to
take
action
,
but
it
’s
also
important
to
use
common
sense
and
have
a
basic
understanding
of
your
responsibilities
and
requirements
.

In
this
post
,
we
’ll
look
at
how
to
start
a
business
while
avoiding
costly
pitfalls
or
embarrassments
.

Your
Business
Name

If
you
’ve
wanted
to
start
a
business
for
awhile
now
,
you
may
have
had
your
business
name
selected
for
years
--
but
it
’s
important
that
you
do
a
little
bit
of
research
before
running
with
the
business
name
of
your
dreams
so
that
you
do
n’t
have
any
nasty
surprises
cropping
up
in
the
future
.

Trademarks

When
you
register
your
business
name
with
your
state
or
local
government
,
it
’s
likely
they
’ll
do
a
name
search
for
availability
before
placing
your
business
on
file
.

However
,
it
’s
important
to
note
that
state
acceptance
of
your
chosen
business
name
is
not
to
be
taken
as
broad
permission
to
use
it
,
nor
does
it
imply
that
you
have
exclusive
rights
to
the
name
.

Your
Secretary	B	Secretary of State	United_States_Secretary_of_State	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State	000	000
of	I	Secretary of State	United_States_Secretary_of_State	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State	000	000
State	I	Secretary of State	United_States_Secretary_of_State	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State	000	000
will
search
state
records
to
make
sure
there
’s
no
other
business
entity
of
the
same
type
on
file
with
the
same
name
;
other
business
filings
,
such
as
county
DBA	B	DBA	Doing_business_as	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doing_business_as	000	000
registrations
,
may
or
may
not
be
subject
to
a
similar
search
.

But
this
search
is
done
only
to
ensure
compliance
with
that
state
’s
name
availability
guidelines
;
it
does
not
,
for
example
,
check
records
of
neighboring
states
for
business
name
similarities
.

Instead
,
it
’s
your
responsibility
to
check
trademark
registrations
,
both
with
the
US	B	US Patent and Trademark Office	United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office	000	000
Patent	I	US Patent and Trademark Office	United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office	000	000
and	I	US Patent and Trademark Office	United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office	000	000
Trademark	I	US Patent and Trademark Office	United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office	000	000
Office	I	US Patent and Trademark Office	United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office	000	000
and
other
state
and
local
agencies
.

Additionally
,
look
into
the
various
public
databases
that
collect
and
archive
information
on
unregistered
trademarks
,
as
registration
is
not
necessary
for
all
trademark
benefits
.

Signs
and
Logos

Consider
a
spa
and
wellness
center
called
Aloha
Dreams
Hawaiian
Destinations
.

It
sounds
like
a
beautiful
place
to
relax
--
until
you
drive
up
and
see
a
big
sign
that
says
“
ADHD
”
out
front
.

Or
what
about
Peter
,
who
did
n’t
realize
his
Military
Surplus
shop
sign
would
cause
13-year-old
boys
to
snigger
about
the
female
reproductive
system
.

It
’s
important
to
look
at
your
business
name
at
all
angles
.

If
any
iteration
of
it
has
the
potential
to
shock
or
induce
giggles
,
it
might
be
worth
reconsidering
.

Your
Industry
Competitors

You
would
n’t
enter
a
fight
without
checking
out
the
competition
,
would
you
?

The
NFL	B	NFL	National_Football_League	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League	000	000
greats
watch
video
of
upcoming
opponents
to
scope
out
any
weaknesses
and
use
them
to
their
best
advantage
.

If
you
want
to
attract
customers
,
you
need
to
know
what
their
experience
is
with
your
competitors
so
you
know
how
to
make
their
experience
with
you
a
better
one
.

Try
surreptitiously
placing
an
order
with
one
of
the
giants
in
your
field
.

If
it
’s
a
service
,
take
careful
note
of
their
language
,
how
they
’re
treating
you
,
and
what
areas
you
,
as
a
customer
,
might
wish
to
be
improved
on
.

If
it
’s
a
product
,
note
the
packaging
,
the
presentation
,
and
the
product
itself
.

Now
,
think
of
ways
that
you
could
not
only
measure
up
,
but
take
the
lead
.

If
they
include
a
printed
thank-you
note
,
you
might
make
yours
handwritten
.

If
they
use
a
great
deal
of
packaging
,
you
might
make
it
a
point
to
use
less
,
and
advertise
your
company
’s
commitment
to
reducing
your
carbon
footprint
.

Always
look
for
ways
to
make
your
business
better
than
the
competitors
.

(
And
remember
:
if
you
do
n’t
have
any
competitors
,
it
’s
possible
you
maybe
have
taken
a
wrong
turn
.

All
industries
have
competitors
.
)

Your
Ongoing
Compliance
Requirements

Simply
registering
your
business
name
is
n’t
enough
.

You
’ll
need
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
local
,
state
,
and
federal
offices
and
agencies
,
and
many
of
those
requirements
--
and
the
relevant
agencies
themselves
--
depend
on
your
business
structure
and
industry
.

Publication
Requirements

Many
states
require
DBAs
,
or
unincorporated
Doing
Business
As
businesses
(
such
as
sole
proprietorships
)
,
to
publish
notice
of
their
filing
in
a
newspaper
of
general
circulation
in
the
business
’s
county
;
examples
include
California	B	California	California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California	000	000
and
Pennsylvania	B	Pennsylvania	Pennsylvania	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania	000	000
.

Many
other
states
require
new
corporations
and
LLCs
to
do
the
same
.

Check
your
filing
jurisdiction
’s
website
(
typically
your
Secretary	B	Secretary of State	United_States_Secretary_of_State	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State	000	000
of	I	Secretary of State	United_States_Secretary_of_State	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State	000	000
State	I	Secretary of State	United_States_Secretary_of_State	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State	000	000
or
County	B	County Clerk	Clerk_(municipal_official)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerk_(municipal_official)	000	000
Clerk	I	County Clerk	Clerk_(municipal_official)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerk_(municipal_official)	000	000
)
for
specific
requirements
,
and
make
sure
you
understand
all
of
the
details
.

(
Is
it
enough
to
simply
publish
notice
,
or
do
you
have
to
file
proof
of
publication
with
your
state
government
?

IRS
Requirements
:
EIN

Any
time
you
earn
money
throughout
the
year
,
you
’ll
need
to
report
your
income
to
the
IRS	B	IRS	Internal_Revenue_Service	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service	000	000
.

Not
all
business
structures
require
an
EIN
--
sole
proprietorships
,
for
example
,
may
use
the
sole
proprietor
’s
Social	B	Social Security Number	Social_Security_number	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number	000	000
Security	I	Social Security Number	Social_Security_number	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number	000	000
Number	I	Social Security Number	Social_Security_number	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number	000	000
,
if
they
wish
--
but
whatever
the
case
,
if
you
’re
making
money
,
the
IRS	B	IRS	Internal_Revenue_Service	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service	000	000
wants
to
know
.

State
Taxes

You
’ll
also
need
to
register
your
business
with
your
state
tax
office
,
especially
if
you
have
employees
,
since
you
’ll
also
need
to
pay
state
taxes
.

To
do
this
,
you
’ll
receive
a
State
Tax
ID
number
,
typically
from
your
state
’s
Department	B	Department of Revenue	Pennsylvania_Department_of_Revenue	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Department_of_Revenue	000	000
of	I	Department of Revenue	Pennsylvania_Department_of_Revenue	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Department_of_Revenue	000	000
Revenue	I	Department of Revenue	Pennsylvania_Department_of_Revenue	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Department_of_Revenue	000	000
,
Tax	B	Tax Assessor	Tax_assessment	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_assessment	000	000
Assessor	I	Tax Assessor	Tax_assessment	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_assessment	000	000
,
or
other
office
.

Contact
your
Secretary
of
State
--
they
’ll
be
able
to
point
you
in
the
right
direction
!

Business
Licenses
and
Permits

Depending
on
your
activities
,
you
may
be
required
to
obtain
business
licenses
or
permits
from
any
number
of
city
,
county
,
or
state
government
agencies
.

For
example
,
you
may
need
a
city
sales
permit
,
in
addition
to
any
regulatory
licenses
for
those
sales
(
gun
permit
,
liquor
license
,
and
so
on
)
.

Other
Requirements

This
is
not
to
be
taken
as
a
comprehensive
list
of
all
of
your
business
responsibilities
.

Rather
,
it
should
get
you
started
thinking
about
what
types
of
government
agencies
and
offices
you
might
need
to
contact
to
determine
any
potential
next
steps
forward
after
starting
your
business
.

Remember
,
a
corporate
lawyer
or
legal
advisor
can
help
you
make
these
determinations
and
keep
you
in
compliance
so
you
do
n’t
have
potentially
hefty
fines
and
late
fees
crop
up
.

Good
luck
!

Search
the
Internet
for
Your
Copyrighted
Material

Posted
By
Sarah
on
Thursday
23
February
2012

Creative
professionals
today
are
more
at
risk
of
becoming
victims
of
copyright
infringement
today
than
ever
before
--
with
everything
interconnected
and
easily
accessible
,
the
ability
to
provide
someone
else
’s
recording
for
download
or
snag
and
repost
a
photo
is
now
child
’s
play
.

Andy
Wright

some

reserved
.

But
,
conversely
,
it
’s
now
also
a
simple
matter
for
you
to
monitor
the
Internet
for
improper
use
.

Where
years
ago
uncovering
a
source
of
bootlegged
editions
might
take
months
,
if
not
years
,
material
uploaded
to
the
Internet
is
discoverable
almost
immediately
.

Here
’s
how
you
can
stay
vigil
and
cast
your
net
for
improper
use
of
your
material
.

Google
Images

You
know
that
Google	B	Google Images	Google_Images	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Images	000	000
Images	I	Google Images	Google_Images	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Images	000	000
is
a
great
way
to
search
the
Internet
for
images
by
keyword
,
but
did
you
know
you
can
also
use
it
to
look
for
duplicates
of
a
specific
image
?

If
you
’ve
been
doing
your
Google	B	Google	Google	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google	000	000
searches
in
the
little
corner
tab
on
your
browser
,
but
you
have
n’t
been
to
the
homepage
lately
(
since
around
June
of
2011
)
,
you
may
not
be
aware
of
this
feature
--
but
it
’s
key
to
searching
the
Internet
for
your
material
if
you
’re
a
painter
,
photographer
,
or
other
visual
artist
.

Give
it
a
shot
--
head
over
to
Google	B	Google	Google	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google	000	000
’s
homepage
and
look
in
the
search
bar
:
you
’ll
see
a
little
camera
.

Click
that
,
upload
the
picture
you
’re
looking
for
,
and
voilà
--
you
’ll
know
who
’s
been
hosting
your
material
before
you
can
say
Click	B	Click	Click_consonant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_consonant	000	000
.

TinEye

Before
Google	B	Google	Google	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google	000	000
,
there
was
TinEye
.

This
small
Canadian	B	Canadian	Canada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada	000	000
company
was
using
image
recognition
software
far
before
Google	B	Google	Google	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google	000	000
implemented
it
(
Google	B	Google	Google	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google	000	000
image
searches
were
previously
text-based
and
relied
on
tags
and
descriptions
)
,
and
they
have
a
very
small
,
dedicated
team
that
has
been
working
for
years
to
categorize
and
make
available
literally
billions
of
images
.

Their
parent
company
,
Idée
Inc
,
has
produced
other
image
recognition
software
programs
that
you
may
find
useful
on
your
hunt
.

Search
in
Quotes

And
then
there
’s
my
personal
favorite
,
useful
for
locating
written
material
:
just
go
to
your
favorite
search
engine
and
type
in
the
first
sentence
or
two
in
quotes
.

The
results
will
show
you
where
the
written
material
has
been
reprinted
.

It
’s
also
a
serviceable
,
if
inelegant
,
way

connecting
snippets

songs

bands
responsible

’ve
found

At
the
end
of
the
day
,
it
’s
important
to
be
aware
and
engaged
.

And
if
you
do
find
that
your
copyrighted
material
is
being
hosted
somewhere
without
your
permission
,
it
’s
always
a
good
idea
to
send
a
friendly
request
that
your
music
is
taken
down
.

After
all
,
not
everyone
is
aware
that
it
’s
not
legal
to
repost
pictures
or
photographs
belonging
to
someone
else
;
there
may
be
no
malice
intended
,
and
the
person
using
your
work
might
take
it
down
immediately
with
apologies
.

(
Or
,
of
course
,
it
’s
your
right
to
allow
them
to
keep
using
the
image
,
provided
they
attribute
it
to
you
and
link
back
to
your
sight
.
)

And
if
you
do
n’t
receive
a
response
,
there
’s
one
more
alternative
before
jumping
into
a
legal
battle
:

“
The
Power
of
the
One-Page
Strategy
”
by
Michele
Welsh
of
Young
Entrepreneur

Somewhere
between
the
formal
business
plan
and
the
cocktail
napkin
to-do
list
is
the
one-page
strategy
,
an
excellent
way
to
make
sure
your
business
is
headed
in
the
right
direction
.

(
Spoiler
alert

Without

,
your
business
is
going
in
no
direction

Want

In
this
article
,
Ms.
Helbig
shows
us
by
example
how
not

explains
where
your
business
’s
focus
should
be
:
your

Toren
of

You
might
not
be
literally
pitching
your
business
to
a
potential
investor
in
an
elevator
,
but
pretend
you
are
--
you
should
be
able
to
explain
your
business
concisely
and
succinctly
in
about
as
long
as
an
elevator
ride
might
take
.

Baseball

appreciate

“
Going
green
”
is
all
the
fad
--
but
for
many
businesses
,
it
’s
a
fad
reminiscent
of
the
food
industry
’s
obsession
with
“
natural
”
marketing
,
where
the
term
was
bandied
about
as
a
marketing
chip
and
any
meaningful
connection
with
health
was
essentially
lost
.

Similarly
,
a
barrage
of
corporate
“
green
”
marketing
terminology
does
not
a
truly
green
company
make
,
and
it
’s
easy
to
become
numb
to
the
idea
that
there
really
are
good
businesses
out
there
doing
really
good
things
for
the
environment
in
ways
that
transcend
marketing
and
self-promotion
altogether
.

But
in
business
,
the
ability
to
assign
value
is
king
,
and
perhaps
the
problem
with
ecocommerce
is
that
there
’s
no
standard
for
really
quantifying
it
.

But
thanks
to
Tim
Gieseke
and
EcoCommerce
101
,
now
we
can
.

EcoCommerce
101
:
Adding
an
ecological
dimension
to
the
economy

According
to
Gieseke
,
“
EcoCommerce
...
provides
the
framework
to
build
an
ecological
intelligence
system
that
allows
the
public
arena
of
commerce
to
define
sustainability
.
”

Gieseke
shows
us
that
economic
development
and
bio-ecological
preservation
are
more
inherently
connected
than
you
might
think
,
and
that
the
two
goals
can
be
met
(
and
,
in
fact
,
are
one
and
the
same
)
with
coordinated
effort
and
a
renewed
dedication
to
seeing
economy
and
ecology
through
the
same
lens
.

Gieseke
points
out
that
“
sustainability
”
is
defined
by
us
,
the
participants
in
the
economy
.

EcoCommerce
101
is
a
roadmap
for
reshaping
the
market
to
support
a
sustainable
future
we
can
all
be
proud
of
.

Registered
Agent
Q&A
:
Help
for
Small
Business
Owners

Posted
By
Sarah
on
Wednesday
8
February
2012

When
you
’re
starting
a
small
business
,
time
is
of
the
essence
.

The
sooner
you
file
your
Articles	B	Articles of Incorporation	Articles_of_Incorporation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Incorporation	000	000
of	I	Articles of Incorporation	Articles_of_Incorporation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Incorporation	000	000
Incorporation	I	Articles of Incorporation	Articles_of_Incorporation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Incorporation	000	000
,
the
closer
you
are
to
opening
your
doors
and
sharing
your
business
with
the
world
--
so
it
’s
important
to
fully
understand
your
incorporation
requirements
from
the
beginning
to
avoid
any
lengthy
delays
or
rejections
.

In
most
states
,
having
a
registered
agent
on
file
is
one
of
those
requirements
.

This
Q&A
is
designed
to
better
understand
your
registered
agent
requirements
as
well
as
highlight
potential
concerns
involved
in
acting
as
registered
agent
yourself
.

What
is
a
registered
agent
?

When
a
business
is
incorporated
,
it
becomes
a
legal
entity
--
a
legal
person
--
just
like
you
and
me
.

(
Of
course
,
a
corporation
has
limited
rights
and
powers
;
a
corporation
can
not
vote
or
be
married
,
for
example
.
)

But
for
practical
reasons
,
a
corporation
must
have
an
individual
as
the
point
person
for
the
business
,
someone
to
whom
correspondence
may
be
sent
or
legal
papers
may
be
served
.

(
It
’s
hard
to
have
a
face-to-face
interaction
with
something
as
abstract
as
a
business
entity
.
)

A
registered
agent
is
that
point
person
.

If
the
state
needs
to
send
a
notice
to
your
company
regarding
any
compliance
news
or
filing
deadlines
,
they
send
the
notice
to
the
registered
agent
.

If
someone
sues
your
small
business
,
the
registered
agent
is
served
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
.

Or
if
another
company
needs
your
permission
in
order
to
register
a
name
similar
to
yours
,
the
contact
information
available
to
them
is
the
registered
agent
’s
.

What
types
of
businesses
need
a
registered
agent
?

Any
business
that
has
been
organized
at
the
state
level
and
is
a
separate
legal
entity
from
its
owners
is
required
to
have
a
registered
agent
on
file
:
corporations
,
limited
liability
companies
,
and
nonprofit
organization
,
for
example
,
are
all
required
to
provide
a
registered
agent
in
their
Articles	B	Articles of Incorporation	Articles_of_Incorporation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Incorporation	000	000
of	I	Articles of Incorporation	Articles_of_Incorporation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Incorporation	000	000
Incorporation	I	Articles of Incorporation	Articles_of_Incorporation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Incorporation	000	000
(
or
Organization	B	Organization	Organization	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization	000	000
,
in
the
case
of
an
LLC
)
.

Foreign
corporations
--
businesses
that
first
incorporated
in
one
state
and
then
expanded
into
and
registered
with
another
--
are
also
required
to
list
a
registered
agent
in
each
state
.

[
Note
:
there
are
a
few
states
,
such
as
Minnesota	B	Minnesota	Minnesota	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota	000	000
and
New	B	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
York	I	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000

The
Eclipse
EffectBreak
Down
or
Break
Through

December
4th
,
2002
:
Total
Solar
Eclipse
in
Sagittarius

Turning
a
crisis
into
an
opportunity
is
the
modern
way
of
looking
at
the
eclipse
effect
.

Do
n't
get
stuck
,
get
a
grip
.

If
you
bury
your
head
in
the
sand
,
then
circumstances
will
force
you
to
make
long
overdue
changes
.

Better
by
far
to
stay
ahead
of
the
game
,
and
volunteer
for
the
inevitable
.

That
way
you
have
a
better
chance
of
staying
in
control
of
events
and
directing
your
future
path
.

Solar
eclipses
happen
every
six
months
,
in
different
cycles
which
recur
every
18.5
years
(
the
Saros	B	Saros Cycle	Saros_(astronomy)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saros_(astronomy)	000	000
Cycle	I	Saros Cycle	Saros_(astronomy)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saros_(astronomy)	000	000
)
.

The
sign
and
cycle
in
which
the
eclipse
occurs
will
tell
you
which
area
of
your
activities
is
shouting
for
a
shakeup
.

In
the
rundown
below
read
your
Sun
sign
and
your
Ascendant	B	Ascendant	Ascendant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascendant	000	000
sign
.

[
If
you
do
n't
know
your
ascendant
,
go
to
www.star4cast.com
FREE
Birth
Charts
and
it
will
calculate
it
for
you
.
]

Take
time
to
work
out
what
happened
to
you
personally
18.5
years
ago
,
or
37
.

The
two
major
domestic/country
moves
in
my
life
took
place
exactly
that
distance
apart
in
the
years
of
eclipses
in
the
same
cycle
.

And
I
only
worked
that
one
out
after
the
decision
was
taken
.

This
approaching
December
solar
eclipse
in
Sagittarius	B	Sagittarius	Sagittarius_(comics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(comics)	000	000
will
obviously
have
more
effect
on
Sagittarian
Sun
or
Ascendant	B	Ascendant	Ascendant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascendant	000	000
types
,
who
are
at
a
real
turning
point
in
their
lives
.

Geminis
are
looking
closely
at
relationships
.

The
other
mutable
signs

and
Pisces	B	Pisces	Pisces_(astrology)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisces_(astrology)	000	000
are
focusing
on
home
and
work
matters
.

This
eclipse
cycle
wo
n't
recur
until
2020
,
so
this
is
your
chance
to
take
the
initiative
,
ask
yourself
fundamental
questions
about
what
you
really
want
to
do
with
this
area
of
your
life
,
and
then
make
the
radical
decisions
necessary
.

The
few
days
before
and
after
an
eclipse
are
usually
fraught
,
highly
strung
,
rather
nervy
,
with
few
(
except
astrology
followers
)
understanding
why
everyone
is
so
on
edge
.

The
eclipse
effect
carries
a
major
theme
for
the
following
six
months
and
will
be
felt
for
a
few
weeks
in
advance
,
so
there
's
no
sense
in
delaying
until
December
4th
.

Get
your
thinking
cap
on
.

In
primitive
days
,
the
ancients
'
view
of
eclipses
was
that
the
darkening
of
the
Sun
was
a
portent
of
doom
,
putting
them
at
the
mercy
of
the
fates
.

But
these
were
highly
superstitious
people
,
with
no
sense
of
control
of
their
lives
.

Eclipses
can
provoke
crises
,
bringing
unwanted
upheavals
,
but
nowadays
you
can
chose
your
attitude
and
your
strategy
.

Some
world
leaders
have
lives
which
seem
eerily
to
follow
eclipses
:

Nelson	B	Nelson Mandela	Nelson_Mandela	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela	000	000
Mandela	I	Nelson Mandela	Nelson_Mandela	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela	000	000
was
imprisoned
,
released
and
became
President
on
the
exact
week
of
eclipses
.

and
then

War	I	Gulf War	Gulf_War	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War	000	000
on
an
extraordinary
series
of
eclipse
driven
events
.

He
gathered
his
troops
on
the
borders
of
Kuwait	B	Kuwait	Kuwait	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait	000	000
on
the
lunar
eclipse
in
late
July
1990
,
two
weeks
before
the
solar
eclipse
on
which
date
the
UN	B	UN	United_Nations	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations	000	000
mandate
to
oppose
him
was
agreed
.

In
the
following
January
on
the
next
Solar
eclipse
,
the
Gulf	B	Gulf War	Gulf_War	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War	000	000
War	I	Gulf War	Gulf_War	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War	000	000
was
launched
.

Princess
Diana	B	Diana	Diana,_Princess_of_Wales	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales	000	000
died
one
day
before
a
solar
eclipse
conjunct
the
potent
,
furiously
angry
Mars	B	Mars	Mars	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars	000	000
Pluto
conjunction
in
Virgo	B	Virgo	Virgo_(astrology)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(astrology)	000	000
in
her
chart.The
previous
eclipse
in
the
same
series
18.5
years
before
fell
within
days
of
the
assassination
of
the
Earl
of
Mountbatten
,
Prince
Charles
'
uncle
.

John
F.
Kennedy
Jnr
was
killed
in
a
plane
crash
days
before
the
major
1999
solar
eclipse
,
which
was
the
same
cycle
as
oversaw
the
death
of
his
stillborn
baby
brother
and
indeed
the
assassination
of
his
father
,
two
cycles
before
.

For
those
of
us
not
caught
up
in
world
events
,
the
effects
are
likely
to
be
much
less
dramatic
or
tragic
,
but
they
are
significant
if
you
really
want
to
grow
and
develop
as
a
human
being
.

This
December
Solar
Eclipse
is
in
a
tricky
Saros	B	Saros Cycle	Saros_(astronomy)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saros_(astronomy)	000	000
Cycle	I	Saros Cycle	Saros_(astronomy)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saros_(astronomy)	000	000
,
usually
accompanying
a
mood
of
high
frustration
,
intense
emotional
reactions
and
a
sense
of
being
stuck
with
circumstances
or
relationship
matters
,
seemingly
beyond
personal
control
.

To
add
to
the
general
feeling
of
angst
,
power-hungry
Pluto
is
close
to
the
eclipse
,
and
the
dreary
Saturn	B	Saturn	Saturn	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn	000	000
opposition
comes
a
few
days
later
,
though
admittedly
optimistic
Jupiter	B	Jupiter	Jupiter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter	000	000
in
Leo	B	Leo	Leo_(comics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(comics)	000	000
is
trying
to
add
a
dash
of
good
luck
as
well
from
a
trine
.

Bernadette
Brady
in
The
Eagle
and
the
Lark	B	Lark	Lark	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lark	000	000
remarks
that
rash
action
is
inadvisable
.

Bush	I	GW Bush	George_W._Bush	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush	000	000
might
do
well
to
pay
heed
.

For
most
of
us
these
are
tough
times
,
with
anchors
dragging
,
and
generally
a
sense
that
life
is
quite
a
struggle
.

Roll
on
the
end
of
the
Saturn
Pluto
opposition
mid
2003
,
and
bring
on
the
joyous
eclipses
of
next
year
.

So
it
's
grit
your
teeth
and
make
the
best
of
it
for
now
.

Here
's
how
:

Sun
and
Ascendant
Sign
:

SAGITTARIUS	B	SAGITTARIUS	Sagittarius_(comics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(comics)	000	000
:
An
eclipse
in
your
own
sign
says
you
are
at
a
crossroads
and
must
chose
your
path
for
the
next
few
years
.

Decisions
need
to
be
pondered
because
there
will
be
no
backtracking
.

Make
up
your
mind
,
get
committed
and
then
get
moving
.

If
you
look
the
other
way
and
ignore
the
eclipse
effect
,
then
a
crisis
in
the
next
few
months
will
force
you
to
see
where
you
have
been
over
compromising
.

Be
independent
,
do
n't
rely
on
others
for
advice
,
let
alone
be
diverted
onto
your
partner
's
agenda
.

It
ai
n't
easy
,
but
you
do
have
choices
.

GEMINI	B	GEMINI	Gemini_(astrology)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(astrology)	000	000
:
Close
emotional
and
work
partnerships
and
your
whole
attitude
to
sharing
,
caring
and
relating
are
under
the
microscope
.

You
must
move
into
a
more
co-operative
frame
of
mind
,
tolerant
,
flexible
and
willing
to
compromise
.

As
an
independent
,
restless
air
sign
,
none
of
this
comes
naturally
.

Old
relationships
may
be
under
strain
and
on
the
point
of
parting
company
.

Do
they
really
suit
your
needs
?

Only
you
know
the
answer
.

Strong
bonds
will
weather
the
storms
.

New
relationships
will
come
as
you
clear
the
decks
of
psychological
debris
from
the
past
.

VIRGO	B	VIRGO	Virgo_(astrology)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(astrology)	000	000
:
At
an
outer
level
,
ensuring
you
have
a
solid
,
secure
home
and
domestic
base
where
you
can
put
down
roots
is
your
cri
de
Coeur
.

At
an
inner
level
you
are
moving
away
from
old
ways
of
relating
and
refusing
to
be
trapped
by
family
members
or
loved
ones
who
want
you
to
stay
exactly
where
and
as
you
are
.

Pushed
and
pulled
by
opposing
demands
from
heavy
work
responsibilities
and
emotional
pressures
,
you
need
to
put
your
own
needs
first
.

When
your
dilemma
threatens
to
get
on
top
of
you
,
go
dig
the
garden
,
walk
in
nature
,
or
have
a
Californian	B	Californian	California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California	000	000
massage
.

Getting
in
touch
with
earth
energy
will
help
.

PISCES
:
Is
a
career
crisis
looming
?

Maybe
it
's
a
hint
from
the
universe
that
you
are
heading
in
the
wrong
direction
and
trying
to
fit
your
talents
into
the
wrong
box
.

You
know
you
want
to
make
your
mark
on
the
world
,
and
have
your
achievements
recognised
,
but
you
have
to
be
fulfilling
what
truly
feels
like
a
vocation
for
that
to
happen
.

With
Pluto
around
,
you
will
also
be
questioning
your
attitude
to
power
figures
and
who
holds
the
control
.

Maybe
you
ca
n't
be
the
megalomaniac
you
'd
like
,
but
you
need
to
ensure
that
no
one
else
is
pulling
your
strings
at
work
either
.

Push
family
responsibilities
into
their
proper
place
and
focus
on
your
ambitions
.

TAURUS	B	TAURUS	Taurus_(comics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(comics)	000	000
:
Two
things
are
dear
to
your
heart
--
one
is
money
and
the
other
is
power
(
OK
and
sex
is
in
there
somewhere
as
well
)
.

Your
sense
of
security
may
be
shaken
because
circumstances
seemingly
outside
your
control
seem
to
be
posing
a
threat
to
your
power
and
prosperity
base
.

This
solar
eclipse
falling
in
the
deepest
,
most
hidden
area
of
your
chart
suggests
you
need
to
get
right
down
to
rock
bottom
to
find
fundamental
answers
to
your
present
sticky
situation
.

As
a
fixed
sign
you
expect
the
world
and
other
people
to
adapt
to
you
,
rather
than
the
other
way
round
.

This
eclipse
says
you
need
to
share
,
care
,
co-operate
and
relate
in
a
profoundly
different
way
in
future
if
you
are
to
improve
joint
finances
and
spark
up
your
sex
life
in
the
months
to
come
--
and
avoid
a
crisis
.

Hanging
on
for
too
much
control
,
could
backfire
.

Trust
the
universe
and
go
with
the
flow
.

SCORPIO	B	SCORPIO	Scorpius	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpius	000	000
:
Money
is
on
your
mind
,
not
joint
finances
as
with
Taurus	B	Taurus	Taurus_(comics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(comics)	000	000
,
but
your
own
personal
piggy-bank
.

In
the
face
of
ungenerous
influences
,
you
know
you
need
to
take
a
major
initiative
to
shake
up
your
finances
to
bring
prosperity
in
the
coming
months
.

Luckily
your
formidable
stamina
will
stand
you
in
good
stead
,
and
Jupiter	B	Jupiter	Jupiter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter	000	000
also
helps
at
your
mid-heaven
,
bringing
a
hint
of
career
success
.

But
you
ca
n't
afford
to
dither
around
,
praying
for
a
lottery
win
or
a
long-lost
relative
to
leave
you
a
fortune
.

Get
real
,
get
thinking
,
and
then
get
working
.

CAPRICORN	B	CAPRICORN	Capricorn_(comics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_(comics)	000	000
:
A
hidden
eclipse
in
the
sign
before
yours
sparks
up
psychological
tensions
,
uncomfortable
echoes
of
unresolved
issues
from
the
past
and
a
general
feeling
of
stuck-ness
.

If
you
can
see
the
awkward
events
happening
around
you
as
useful
pointers
,
reflections
of
what
is
going
on
at
an
inner
level
,
then
you
can
make
real
use
of
this
eclipse
.

Not
naturally
an
inward-looking
sign
,
you
may
need
to
force
yourself
to
ask
the
probing
questions
that
will
bring
profound
answers
.

Do
n't
be
put
off
by
imagining
you
will
find
all
manner
of
horrors
.

On
the
contrary
you
will
find
you
are
a
richer
,
stronger
personality
than
you
could
have
imagined
.

Your
unlived
emotions
tend
to
put
extra
strain
on
your
body
,
so
be
good
to
yourself
physically
by
reaching
for
a
deeper
self-understanding
.

CANCER
:
Sagittarius	B	Sagittarius	Sagittarius_(comics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_(comics)	000	000
is
your
area
for
work
and
health
.

You
will
be
facing
a
dilemma
about
how
to
regenerate
your
career
,
improve
your
working
conditions
and
build
up
your
general
health
.

The
likelihood
with
Pluto
in
place
is
that
you
will
be
meeting
resistance
in
your
efforts
,
but
do
n't
let
that
put
you
off
.

Pluto
can
produce
solidly
substantial
results
,
but
it
usually
takes
a
struggle
and
strong
determination
.

Do
n't
meet
unco-operative
workmates
head
on
in
a
stalemate
battle
.

Duck
and
dive
a
little
.

Aim
for
influence
,
not
outright
control
.

Realise
also
you
have
to
let
go
certain
old
ambitions
which
have
lost
their
fire
.

Physically
you
need
to
pay
better
attention
to
your
body
's
needs
,
get
even
minor
ailments
fixed
,
and
then
you
will
sail
ahead
in
robust
form
.

LEO	B	LEO	Leo_(comics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_(comics)	000	000
:
Love
may
be
on
your
mind
,
but
it
may
not
be
what
you
are
attracting
.

This
eclipse
will
make
you
aware
of
where
you
are
not
getting
the
affection
,
admiration
and
adoration
you
want
from
loved
ones
,
children
or
even
social
mates
.

Tricky
,
I
know
,
to
be
exuberant
and
utterly
seductive
with
the
wet-blanket
Saturn-Pluto
around
.

But
this
is
your
challenge
.

You
need
to
allow
your
personality
to
shine
brightly
,
to
step
out
without
apology
or
doubt
,
to
be
where
you
feel
fulfilled
which
is
centre
stage
.

Two
thoughts
:
one
is
that
what
you
lack
,
you
must
first
give
.

Have
you
been
too
meagre
in
handing
out
kisses
,
cuddles
and
compliments
?

Go
to
it
.

The
second
is
that
Pluto
tends
to
make
you
clutch
if
you
feel
you
are
not
getting
attention
.

Let
go
.

If
you
cage
loved
ones
in
,
they
will
struggle
to
break
free
.

AQUARIUS	B	AQUARIUS	Aquarius_(astrology)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquarius_(astrology)	000	000
:
Always
known
as
the
humanitarian
sign
,
this
could
be
your
chance
to
make
a
real
difference
to
the
society
or
world
in
which
you
live
.

Certainly
you
know
you
need
to
widen
your
circle
of
friends
and
acquaintances
in
the
months
,
if
not
years
to
come
,
but
do
n't
keep
stick
to
a
frivolous
,
exclusively
social
agenda
.

You
could
join
hands
with
influential
movers
and
shakers
to
have
a
powerful
influence
on
what
is
going
on
around
you
.

You
also
know
you
need
to
nudge
yourself
into
setting
long
term
goals
.

Do
n't
just
think
five
year
plan
,
think
20
year
plan
.

It
does
n't
have
to
be
set
in
concrete
,
you
can
adapt
as
you
go
along
,
but
you
will
be
better
with
a
broad
strategy
and
well
defined
goals
.

ARIES
:
Travel
,
communication
,
improving
your
mind
--
all
of
these
are
sparked
off
by
this
eclipse
,
which
is
generally
prompting
you
to
broaden
your
horizons
in
whichever
you
can
.

Set
your
sights
higher
.

Let
your
imagination
soar
.

Think
big
,
do
n't
get
bogged
down
in
trivia
.

Saturn	B	Saturn	Saturn	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn	000	000
Pluto
is
hardly
an
exciting
or
inspirational
overlay
,
but
nonetheless
this
is
your
challenge
.

You
need
to
spread
your
ideas
to
a
wider
audience
,
find
more
intellectual
stimulation
and
see
where
you
can
get
yourself
out
of
a
rut
.

LIBRA
:
Sorting
out
your
everyday
schedule
may
not
sound
like
a
bundle
of
fun
,
but
if
you
do
n't
get
a
grip
of
minutiae
,
details
and
organization
,
then
your
life
will
lack
a
solid
,
realistic
base
.

Think
about
how
you
communicate
.

Are
you
being
misunderstood
at
work
?

Collect
your
thoughts
first
,
speak
simply
and
then
double
check
to
make
sure
your
message
got
across
.

It
may
not
be
the
content
that
's
at
fault
,
more
the
delivery.Start
each
day
with
a
checklist
and
you
wo
n't
race
round
in
circles
getting
in
a
muddle
.

Think
small
for
a
few
months
,
then
you
will
fly
the
higher
come
next
May
.

I
'm
not
in
high
school
anymore
but
I
do
like
to
follow
and
learn
from
around
the
country
from
other
Marching	B	Marching Bands	Marching_band	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_band	000	000
Bands	I	Marching Bands	Marching_band	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_band	000	000
and
their
marching
shows
?

What
is
your
competitive
marching
show
you
are
performing
this
fall
?

So
I
do
n't
just
limit
this
to
just
high
schoolers
,
For
people
not
in
a
marching
band
,
what
is
a
show
you
WISH
you
were
performing
this
fall
?

Dont
cry
for
me
...

Sorry
,
did
you
really
think
I
was
going
to
make
it
through
an
entire
month
in
Argentina	B	Argentina	Argentina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina	000	000
without
one
‘
Dont
Cry
for
me
’
quote
.

Well
today
it
happened
before
we
took
the
city
bus
tour
.

As
we
queued
for
the
buenosairesbus.com
tour
the
suntan
cream
was
running
into
my
eyes
and
one
of
my
friends
said
‘
Dont
Cry
’
to
which
the
reply
was
‘
for
me
Argentina	B	Argentina	Argentina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina	000	000
’
.

Sad
I
know
but
there
you
go
.

So
I
finally
made
it
down
into
the
centre
of
Buenos	B	Buenos Aires	Buenos_Aires	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires	000	000
Aires	I	Buenos Aires	Buenos_Aires	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires	000	000
.

The
city
bus
tour
looked
like
a
good
option
if
I
was
going
to
try
and
avoid
being
mugged
,
robbed
,
beaten
up
,
raped
,
shot
,
stabbed
and
dumped
in
a
skip
.

As
Ive	B	Ive	Jonathan_Ive	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive	000	000
mentioned
previously
I
had
a
whole
shot
list
of
photo
ideas
that
I
wanted
to
do
but
talking
to
my
friends
here
in
the
current
climate
it
would
probably
at
best
end
up
with
me
coming
home
several
kilos
of
camera
equipment
lighter
and
at
worst
several
kilos
of
body
parts
lighter
.

Going
round
on
the
tour
bus
Im	B	Im	Instant_messaging	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging	000	000
not
saying
that
my
friends
were
being
overly
cautious
but
based
more
on
travelling
between
tourist
areas
than
the
tourist
areas
themselves
.

The
bus
is
one
of
those
hop-on
hop-off
affairs
and
it
takes
about
3
and
a
half
hours
to
do
the
circuit
,
we
had
all
day
and
it
was
dull
and
overcast
in
the
morning
.

Typical
,
the
day
I
’m
fit
and
well
enough
to
go
out
and
do
a
major
photo
session
its
the
first
real
overcast
day
we
’ve
had
.

Of
course
the
weather
forecast
for
the
rest
of
my
stay
in
BA
is
thunderstorms
so
manana
doesnt
really
quite
cut
it

So
the
plan
was
to
be
completely
sad
and
stay
on
the
bus
for
the
first
circuit
and
see
if
the
weather
improved
.

This
involved
no
more
effort
than
sticking
the
elbow
out
of
the
side
of
the
bus
and
lying
back
.

Of
course
sticking
the
elbow
out
of
the
side
of
the
bus
was
precisely
how
I
got
a
perfect
triangle
of
peeling
tan
on
my
left
elbow
.

by
now
of
course
this
is
now
redder
and
deeper
but
thats
another
story
.

The
first
thing
I
noticed
about
our
newly
arrived
open
top
bus
was
that
it
wasnt
open
topped
.

There
had
been
some
rain
the
day
before
and
people
got
wet
and
complained
and
tried
to
get
their
money
back
.

The
bus
company
had
then
put
the
bolt
on
rooves
on
.

Great
to
stop
you
getting
wet
,
rubbish
if
you
want
to
sit
at
the
top
of
the
bus
and
look
all
around
you
.

To
those
people
who
complained
about
getting
wet
in
the
rain
on
an
open
topped
bus
I
can
probably
guess
your
nationality
,
but
sure
come
to
Belfast	B	Belfast	Belfast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast	000	000
,
our
open
top
busses
have
a
forcefield
that
deflects
rain
so
you
can
see
all
around
you
in
the
worst
weather
.

Just
remember
its
pay
in
advance
and
absolutely
no
refunds
and
dont
beleive
everything
you
read
on
the
internet
.

So
of
course
I
managed
to
pick
the
wrong
side
of
the
bus
,
the
row
with
no
working
headphones
and
even
if
they
were
the
speakers
behind
me
blasting
out
the
spanish
tour
information
would
have
drowned
them
out
anyway
.

No-one
thought
to
think
that
the
high
volume
setting
might
need
to
come
down
a
bit
now
theres
a
roof
on
.

But
still
very
little
to
see
in
the
dull
grey
light
anyway
and
even
less
to
photograph
.

After
about
3
or
4
stops
of
the
hop
on
hop
off
tour
no-one
had
hopped
on
or
hopped
off
.

I
thought
we
were
going
to
be
the
only
saddos
doing
this
but
it
turned
out
that
the
scare
stories
had
indeed
pervaded
all
of
the
visiting
society
who
deemed
it
safer
just
to
sit
on
this
bright
yellow
bus
.

For
those
reading
and
if
you
are
ever
in
the
same
situation
,
the
left
hand
side
of
the
bus
is
best
,
probably
about
2
or
3
rows
from
the
loudspeakers
at
the
back
.

Judging
by
the
number
of
tree
branches
crashing
off
the
roof
a
crash
helmet
wouldnt
be
a
bad
idea
,
but
definitely
sunglasses
.

Thats
todays
health
and
safety
announcement
over
.

I
love
watching
people
and
I
had
a
real
treat
on
this
trip
,
in
front
of
me
was
a
tourist
couple
,
German	B	German	Germany	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany	000	000
,
who
sat
over
two
rows
of
two
seats
,
both
at
the
window
side
one
behind
the
other
.

For
most
of
the
trip
they
sat
with
their
backpacks
on
the
spare
seats
beside
them
.

People
would
come
up
to
the
top
deck
to
look
for
free
seats
and
they
both
would
ruffle
about
in
their
bag
to
take
up
as
much
space
as
possible
.

You
rarely
see
such
coordination
outside
of
the
synchronised
swimming
in
the
Olympics	B	Olympics	Olympic_Games	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games	000	000
.

The
old
man
in
front
had
a
wee
point
and
shoot
camera
with
a
big
screen
so
it
would
be
rude
of
me
not
to
look
at
what
he
was
shooting
.

All
I
can
say
is
dirty
old
man
.

Every
time
we
stopped
he
would
use
the
high
vantage
point
to
zoom
down
on
some
really
good
looking
tanned
womans
cleavage
and
take
a
photo
.

Im
describing
this
in
great
detail
for
research
purposes
only
.

I
dont
know
if
his
wife
was
aware
,
didnt
know
,
didnt
care
whatever
but
firstly
I
thought
what
a
sleaze
,
secondly
I
thought
I
really
should
have
brought
my
point
and
shoot
(
to
blend
in
and
be
safe
you
understand
,
not
to
look
down
womens
cleavage
)
.

Anyway
at
one
point
in
the
tour
outside
Recoleta	B	Recoleta	Recoleta,_Buenos_Aires	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recoleta,_Buenos_Aires	000	000
these
two
stunningly
beautiful
tall
blonde
women
came
up
to
the
top
of
the
bus
and
had
a
look
round
for
seats
(
either
German	B	German	Germany	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany	000	000
or
Scandinavian
or
similar
)
.

The
old
guy
couldnt
lift
his
bag
off
the
seat
quick
enough
,
Im	B	Im	Instant_messaging	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging	000	000
sure
he
was
verging
on
hernia
territory
he
moved
that
quickly
.

But
they
took
one
look
and
moved
down
the
bus
.

Following
them
up
the
stairs
were
two
huge
black
guys
and
our
hero
couldnt
get
the
bag
down
in
time
before
one
took
up
residence
beside
him
.

I
must
have
seemed
a
right
idiot
laughing
away
to
myself
.

Driving
round
on
the
bus
we
got
to
see
pretty
much
all
the
tourist
sites
and
spots
,
in
complete
contrast
to
my
previous
experience
,
BA	B	BA	Bachelor_of_Arts	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts	000	000
is
a
beautiful
city
,
full
of
wide
avenues
,
mixtures
of
old
colonial
buildings
,
modern
architecture
,
european
with
a
hint
of
not
.

The
commercial
area
is
pretty
much
the
same
as
any
commercial
area
in
any
big
city
in
the
world
and
down
here
it
was
the
first
I
’d
seen
of
multinationals
and
billboard
type
advertising
.

Again
little
to
separate
the
place
from
most
other
world
cities
.

Its
the
quirky
nature
of
some
places
,
the
old
decaying
buildings
,
the
former
rich
family
palaces
who
when
they
fell
on
hard
times
sold
out
to
foreign
governments
so
there
is
an
area
filled
with
some
of
the
best
looking
embassies
in
the
world
.

Its
not
really
a
walk
around
city
as
a
lot
of
it
is
very
spread
out
(
as
the
3
and
a
half
hour
bus
tour
with
only
12
stops
)
would
tell
you
,
but
there
are
areas
that
it
looked
like
it
would
be
very
safe
to
walk
around
.

Its
a
strange
mix
,
one
of
the
locals
told
me
theres
no
real
middle
class
,
just
rich
and
poor
and
this
certainly
seems
to
be
borne
out
travelling
round
.

The
bus
tour
mainly
goes
through
rich
areas
but
down
around
La	B	La Boca	La_Boca	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Boca	000	000
Boca	I	La Boca	La_Boca	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Boca	000	000
it
goes
through
areas
the
police
had
told
me
not
to
walk
through
.

Of
course
these
are
the
areas
with
the
friendliest
people
,
waving
and
smiling
at
the
people
on
the
bus
.

The
weather
was
picking
up
as
we
finished
our
first
circuit
so
we
decided
to
stay
on
the
bus
and
go
round
again
and
get
off
at
Recoleta
,
famous
for
us
primarily
as
the
area
containing
the
Recoleta
cemetary
and
the
tomb
of
Evita
Peron
.

The
bus
stops
outside
the
tourist
office
and
theres
a
half
hour
wait
before
it
continues
so
we
chatted
and
I
decided
to
get
off
the
bus
,
get
some
photos
of
the
nearby
Plaza
De
Mayo
before
we
set
off
.

Of
course
the
driver
and
guide
had
nicked
off
for
a
mate
and
a
smoke
so
we
were
locked
in
,
something
they
dont
tell
you
so
be
warned

So
at
this
point
I
have
a
confession
to
make
,
well
not
a
confession
of
sorts
but
more
an
explanation
of
how
we
work
.

I
love
getting
all
the
tourist
literature
from
a
place
and
going
through
all
the
photos
and
comparing
whats
in
the
brochures
to
whats
actually
there
.

For
example
,
if
I
want
to
photograph
a
place
in
Ireland	B	Ireland	Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland	000	000
at
dawn
I
would
scout
out
the
location
,
pick
a
good
morning
with
relevant
clouds
,
pick
area
,
pick
spot
,
get
there
well
before
dawn
,
get
photos
,
come
home
,
review
etc
etc.
.

This
might
take
2
or
3
goes
due
to
changing
weather
conditions
,
some
moron
has
parked
a
white
van
in
the
wrong
spot

or
any
multitude
of
things
.

So
the
finished
images
could
have
taken
weeks
of
research
and
maybe
a
couple
of
years
to
get
the
right
sort
of
conditions
.

None
of
which
you
are
going
to
see
speeding
past
in
a
big
yellow
bus
.

You
might
but
its
highly
doubtful
.

Its
like
the
city
tour
,
coming
mid
summer
isnt
going
to
be
a
good
idea
,
going
over
midday
isnt
a
good
idea
,
certain
buildings
will
look
better
in
the
morning
,
or
evening
or
in
the
case
of
the
Theatro
Colon
,
in
May
when
they
take
the
scaffolding
down
!

Im	B	Im	Instant_messaging	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging	000	000
glad
there
isnt
a
trade
descriptions
act
for
tourism
or
Id	B	Id	Identity_document	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document	000	000
be
permanently
in
court
.

‘
Your
honour
,
exhibit
A
,
the
Giants
Causeway
’

‘
Your
honour
,
exhibit
B
,
what
we
saw
,
mist
’

So
bearing
that
in
mind
and
taking
a
more
realistic
view
of
the
descriptions
of
Recoleta	B	Recoleta	Recoleta,_Buenos_Aires	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recoleta,_Buenos_Aires	000	000
cemetary
I
went
forearmed
.

I
have
to
say
though
,
it
lived
up
to
every
single
description
.

The
cemetary
is
for
the
rich
and
famous
of
Argentina	B	Argentina	Argentina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina	000	000
,
its
described
as
a
city
of
the
dead
,
with
streets
,
walkways
,
ornate
buildings
.

No-one
is
buried
underground
(
at
least
that
I
could
tell
)
and
the
whole
place
is
a
show
of
wealth
and
status
,
even
when
you
are
dead
.

Every
word
is
true
,
Ive	B	Ive	Jonathan_Ive	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive	000	000
never
seen
the
like
of
it
before
.

Well
organised
and
laid
out
,
the
equivalent
of
coffin
multistoreys
in
some
cases
.

Glass
doors
with
small
rooms
with
coffins
neatly
stacked
and
laid
out
.

It
seems
strange
for
someone
used
to
burying
people
in
the
ground
or
burning
them
to
see
them
laid
out
in
a
small
living
room
type
environment
.

Some
coffins
hundreds
of
years
old
,
in
most
cases
perfectly
preserved
.

In
some
tombs
the
marble
has
broken
and
bits
of
coffin
sticking
out
here
or
there
adds
to
the
slightly
eerie
feeling
when
you
find
an
avenue
not
populated
by
tourists
.

We
spent
time
wandering
around
and
avoided
the
headlong
rush
to
Evitas
tomb
.

One
of
my
friends
has
a
family
burial
plot
there
that
they
have
never
seen
and
we
found
it
.

A
distant
relative
was
a
general
in
the
army
and
judging
by
the
size
of
the
tomb
was
very
well
off
indeed
and
very
well
thought
of
judging
by
the
number
of
plaques
.

Wandering
back
I
just
kept
an
eye
out
for
a
queue
of
tourists
and
sure
enough
found
evitas
tomb
.

In
relative
terms
it
is
quite
modest
compared
to
some
there
but
probably
the
most
famous
for
non-Argentinians
.

There
is
a
busy
market
on
the
hill
on
the
way
up
to
the
cemetary
,
something
they
dont
show
you
in
the
tourist
brochures
of
the
walls

Its
a
place
selling
all
sorts
of
tourist
tat
but
notorious
for
pickpockets
so
watch
out
.

That
pretty
much
sums
up
the
bus
tour
of
BA	B	BA	Bachelor_of_Arts	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts	000	000
for
me
,
lots
of
nice
looking
places
but
little
in
the
way
of
real
interest
for
me
.

I
could
have
got
on
and
off
and
did
a
lot
more
tourist
shots
of
buildings
rather
than
just
drive
bys
but
unlike
other
cities
I
do
get
bad
vibes
from
acting
the
tourist
here
.

Ideally
Id
like
to
take
time
over
things
hanging
around
waiting
for
decent
or
the
‘
right
’
light
to
photograph
things
,
take
pictures
of
local
people
doing
local
things
and
generally
experiencing
the
life
of
the
place
but
with
a
camera
and
lens
worth
more
than
most
people
make
here
in
a
year
,
the
gulf
in
society
,
the
massive
and
unpublished
inflation
and
similarly
underplayed
unemployment
figures
I
have
to
realise
that
I
would
like
to
go
home
in
one
piece
.

For
me
thats
the
saddest
thing
about
being
here
,
a
beautiful
city
but
I
suspect
there
isnt
much
income
from
tourism
to
justify
the
extra
spend
making
people
feel
safer
.

Travel
forums
are
full
of
stories
of
tourists
being
victims
of
crime
and
yes
the
internet
gives
a
voice
to
the
dozen
or
so
people
affected
,
thats
not
to
diminish
their
plights
but
there
are
perhaps
thousands
that
nothing
has
happened
to
.

Im
not
a
normal
tourist
though
,
I
carry
a
lot
of
expensive
equipment
,
I
have
two
cellphones
with
me
,
both
of
which
have
never
left
my
room
in
the
apartment
.

I
have
a
‘
cheap
’
swatch
watch
that
has
never
been
on
my
wrist
since
the
airport
,
I
cant
wear
half
my
travel
clothes
as
they
would
signal
me
out
as
a
target
.

Its
something
I
feel
stronger
here
,
again
perhaps
my
friends
are
being
overcautious
but
as
with
the
kidney
stones
incident
it
will
be
them
left
to
pick
up
the
pieces
and
I
have
to
bow
to
their
judgement
,
they
are
the
people
who
live
here
and
are
on
the
ground
day
in
day
out
.

There
are
some
beautiful
photos
of
Buenos	B	Buenos Aires	Buenos_Aires	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires	000	000
Aires	I	Buenos Aires	Buenos_Aires	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires	000	000
out
there
,
Id	B	Id	Identity_document	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document	000	000
come
with
loads
of
ideas
of
how
to
do
them
my
way
but
sadly
thats
not
going
to
be
the
case
,
Im
sure
things
will
improve
here
,
just
as
probably
things
at
home
might
worsen
.

A
friend
of
mine
travelled
round
the
world
10
years
ago
and
has
some
beautiful
photos
of
places
you
would
never
consider
travelling
to
today
.

Similarly
places
he
couldnt
go
then
have
become
must
sees
now
.

Things
will
change
,
cruise
ships
regularly
dock
in
Belfast	B	Belfast	Belfast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast	000	000
now
,
something
not
considered
just
10
years
ago
.

I
have
to
say
though
,
if
you
do
get
the
bus
tour
and
you
only
decide
to
hop
on
and
hop
off
once
,
do
it
at
Recoleta	B	Recoleta	Recoleta,_Buenos_Aires	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recoleta,_Buenos_Aires	000	000
.

It
is
probably
one
of
the
most
unique
places
I
’ve
ever
visited
and
I
say
that
about
very
few
places
I
’ve
been
.

Speaking
of
which
,
its
nearly
time
to
pack
to
head
to
Iguazu	B	Iguazu Falls	Iguazu_Falls	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguazu_Falls	000	000
Falls	I	Iguazu Falls	Iguazu_Falls	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguazu_Falls	000	000
.

Ive	B	Ive	Jonathan_Ive	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive	000	000
just
checked
the
weather
forecast
for
Wednesday
and
they
have
a
‘
feels
like
’
value
.

In
Belfast	B	Belfast	Belfast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast	000	000
its
normally
something
like
2C
but
feels
like
-5
C.
For
Iguazu
its
39C
feels
like
56C
.

Poke
me
with
a
stick
and
tell
me
when
I
’m
done
.

Well
it
had
to
happen
,
the
luck
had
to
run
out
sometime
.

In
the
middle
of
a
stock
photo
shoot
on
Weds
evening
I
just
didnt
feel
well
at
all
.

Suddenly
started
getting
twinges
in
my
lower
back
.

Now
Ive	B	Ive	Jonathan_Ive	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive	000	000
had
them
before
but
the
thoughts
of
getting
sick
in
another
foreign
country
really
didnt
appeal
.

A
quick
trip
to
the
loo
and
it
confirmed
that
another
bout
of
kidney
stones
was
on
its
way
rapidly
.

When
I
was
a
kid
I
remember
my
dad
being
plagued
by
them
so
it
was
likely
Id	B	Id	Identity_document	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document	000	000
get
them
at
some
point
.

Although
looking
back
you
just
dont
realise
the
pain
people
are
in
until
you
feel
it
for
yourself
.

Those
of
you
that
know
me
will
also
know
Ive	B	Ive	Jonathan_Ive	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ive	000	000
been
taking
painkillers
almost
constantly
for
11
years
now
due
to
an
old
recurring
injury
.

All
that
extra
calcium
probably
doesnt
help
.

I
have
refrained
from
blogging
and
facebooking
about
being
painkiller/tablet
free
due
to
the
heat
and
humidity
for
12
days
(
until
the
antihistamine
mosquito
bites
incidents
last
week
)
because
I
knew
it
would
set
me
up
for
a
fall
.

Now
those
of
you
who
have
had
kidney
stones
know
that
they
can
just
pass
with
minor
irritation
and
there
are
times
when
it
feels
like
you
are
trying
to
piss
a
concrete
block
.

This
was
the
latter
.

Within
half
an
hour
I
was
sitting
on
the
floor
in
a
pool
of
sweat
trying
to
knock
the
co-codamol
into
me
as
quickly
as
I
could
manage
.

After
taking
the
recommended
dosage
for
8
hours
in
15
mins
it
had
eased
somewhat
enough
for
me
to
try
getting
into
the
shower
.

How
I
thought
this
would
help
I
didnt
know
but
I
certainly
wasnt
going
to
get
any
wetter
than
I
was
.

By
this
time
my
flatmates
had
noticed
my
absence
and
packed
up
the
gear
as
Id	B	Id	Identity_document	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document	000	000
just
left
the
camera
on
the
ground
and
disappeared
.

I
asked
them
to
get
me
to
a
doctor
.

After
2
hours
(
well
it
was
probably
more
like
2
mins
)
I
noticed
them
in
discussion
to
which
the
outburst
was
‘
what
part
of
get
me
to
a
doctor
,
do
you
not
understand
?
’

or
words
to
that
effect
,
there
might
have
been
slight
swearing
involved
.

Well
a
lot
of
swearing
,
infact
every
2nd
word
was
f
...

Now
Im	B	Im	Instant_messaging	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging	000	000
not
one
for
panicking
,
I
rarely
panic
and
usually
in
the
worst
situations
can
still
think
logically
.

The
issue
my
friends
had
was
that
they
didnt
know
a
doctor
,
theyd
never
had
call
to
call
one
.

Not
like
my
poor
dad
who
often
commented
that
a
holiday
in
our
house
always
ended
up
with
one
or
more
of
us
visiting
the
local
accident
and
emergency
.

In
fact
by
the
time
of
any
incident
my
dad
could
tell
you
which
doctors
was
open
,
which
hospital
was
on
A+E
intake
and
which
local
chemist
was
open
on
the
rota
.

So
,
again
,
interspersed
with
swearwords
I
requested
my
friends
to
find
the
nearest
flat
with
old
people
or
with
kids
as
they
invariably
would
know
where
the
nearest
doctor
was
.

I
also
said
that
the
building
porter
will
know
.

They
said
he
wouldnt
and
I
slightly
forcefully
told
them
to
at
least
walk
out
of
the
room
and
pretend
they
were
doing
as
I
asked
.

Poor
guys
didnt
know
what
to
do
,
Not
even
watching
rapper
videos
on
MTV	B	MTV	MTV	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV	000	000
had
prepared
them
for
the
sheer
volume
of
swearing
an
irishman
in
excruciating
pain
can
muster
.

We
briefly
discussed
them
looking
up
my
travel
insurance
company
on
the
web
and
ringing
them
for
advice
.

I
finally
just
produced
every
bit
of
cash
I
owned
,
my
credit
cards
,
passport
and
doubled
over
in
the
hall
informed
them
that
I
was
leaving
for
the
nearest
hospital
and
to
summon
a
taxi
.

At
a
party
earlier
in
the
trip
someone
here
asked
me
what
the
people
in
the
rest
of
the
world
were
like
,
were
they
helpful
and
friendly
.

I
said
that
no
matter
where
I
went
people
in
the
main
seem
always
willing
to
help
a
stranger
.

I
gave
the
example
in
a
recent
trip
to
Northern
Nicosia
I
had
got
lost
on
the
backstreets
and
my
leg
pain
had
increased
.

I
sat
down
and
took
a
tablet
and
drank
the
last
of
my
water
with
it
.

Three
late
teenage
or
early
twenties
guys
came
up
to
me
and
I
thought
‘
oh
shit
here
we
go
’
.

They
didnt
say
anything
just
smiled
and
handed
me
a
fruit
sweet
and
walked
off
.

There
is
nothing
like
the
kindness
of
strangers
,
particularly
alone
far
from
home
.

With
all
the
wars
and
fighting
and
reasons
given
for
people
to
kill
each
other
,
when
you
get
down
to
individuals
requiring
help
or
just
a
smile
then
in
most
places
people
will
offer
it
.

I
suffered
horrific
injuries
in
Kenya	B	Kenya	Kenya	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya	000	000
11
years
ago
,
injuries
that
would
have
left
someone
local
to
die
but
everyone
I
met
was
supportive
,
it
wasnt
until
I
reached
London	B	London	London	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London	000	000
that
people
didnt
care
.

A
lesson
there
perhaps
.

In
what
seemed
like
an
eternity
a
taxi
arrived
and
I
was
whisked
at
the
speed
of
light
as
only
taxi
drivers
know
how
to
do
to
the
local
hospital
.

I
was
given
a
number
and
told
to
take
a
seat
which
was
easier
said
than
done
.

From
home
experience
I
expected
to
wait
about
an
hour
to
be
seen
and
be
doubled
up
all
that
time
.

I
was
seen
in
less
than
10
mins
,
explained
the
situation
and
about
10
mins
later
had
the
much
needed
painkilling
injection
.

10
mins
after
that
I
was
sort
of
back
to
normal
with
only
the
now
translucent
skin
colour
that
comes
with
severe
pain
showing
any
problem
at
all
.

If
you
havent
encountered
this
phenomenon
,
lucky
you
,
I
dont
know
the
technical
reasons
but
all
blood
and
colour
leaves
the
skin
,
probably
the
defense
mechanism
taking
blood
away
from
non-important
areas
.

The
only
spots
of
colour
I
had
were
now
the
remaining
multiple
mosquito
bites
.

Another
difference
from
home
was
that
the
doctor
sent
me
for
tests
to
make
sure
I
didnt
have
an
infection
and
that
was
all
done
in
an
hour
and
I
was
sent
home
with
the
all
clear
but
told
to
drink
as
much
water
as
I
could
get
down
me
over
the
next
few
days
and
at
least
whilst
I
was
still
in
the
country
.

So
back
in
the
apartment
things
started
to
return
to
normal
.

Pain
was
subsiding
and
colour
was
starting
to
return
.

I
drank
about
2
litres
of
water
in
the
next
hour
which
the
guys
had
prepared
for
me
and
tried
to
get
some
sleep
.

By
now
it
was
3am
and
if
things
hadve
been
normal
Id	B	Id	Identity_document	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document	000	000
have
been
getting
up
at
6am
to
set
off
on
my
pre
booked
day
trip
to
Colonia
Del
Sacremento
,
Uruguay	B	Uruguay	Uruguay	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay	000	000
.

Being
the
idiot
I
am
and
having
been
through
this
experience
a
couple
of
times
before
at
home
I
thought
,
ah
sure
I
’ll
get
up
at
6am
anyway
and
see
how
I
feel
...
.

I
cant
finish
this
posting
without
giving
my
thanks
to
my
flatmates
Gaspar
,
Juan
and
Luis
whose
role
in
all
the
above
is
portrayed
humourously
but
who
showed
that
despite
language
differences
,
despite
cultural
differences
that
there
is
kindness
in
strangers
the
world
over
.

I
appreciate
everything
you
did
for
me
lads
,
muchas
gracias
amigos
.

Also
thanks
to
the
hospital
staff
at
the
hospital
whose
name
I
still
dont
know
,
who
like
hospital
staff
everywhere
are
overwork
and
under
appreciated
by
the
people
who
have
never
been
unfortunate
enough
to
have
required
their
services
.

The
Dangers
of
Travel
Photography

Search
Radharcimages

This
is
very
much
a
case
of
do
as
I
say
,
not
as
I
do
.

We
are
all
well
aware
of
the
dangers
of
travel
photography
.

I
often
like
a
wingman/wingwoman/wingperson
to
watch
my
back
in
a
strange
place
whenever
Im	B	Im	Instant_messaging	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging	000	000
concentrating
on
camera
stuff
and
actually
taking
photos
.

Its
either
that
or
the
one
setting
get
the
camera
out
take
the
photo
and
put
it
back
again
which
never
really
does
the
job
properly
.

Having
been
brought
up
in
a
rough
area
I
like
to
pride
myself
on
seeing
and
recognising
a
hood/crook/criminal
no
matter
where
I
am
in
the
world
but
it
always
pays
to
be
careful
.

The
less
time
an
expensive
camera
is
on
show
the
better
.

One
advantage
of
being
rather
scruffy
in
general
is
that
people
tend
not
to
bother
you
.

Its
particularly
good
when
you
look
like
you
havent
eaten
in
a
while
.

My
dad
told
me
about
how
he
went
into
London	B	London	London	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London	000	000
one
night
and
won
a
lot
of
money
on
the
dogs
,
he
was
standing
in
the
underground
early
in
the
morning
on
a
deserted
platform
with
the
money
in
his
pocket
.

A
group
of
guys
arrived
and
my
dad
having
worked
in
a
bookies
for
a
long
time
knew
these
guys
would
be
up
to
no
good
.

So
he
put
10
pence
in
his
hand
and
walked
across
to
one
of
the
litter
bins
on
the
platform
.

He
bent
down
and
pretended
to
pick
it
up
off
the
floor
then
proceded
to
go
to
the
nearby
chocolate
bar
machine
and
buy
a
bar
.

He
shoved
it
into
his
mouth
as
if
he
hadnt
eaten
all
day
.

He
looked
around
and
the
guys
had
left
,
probably
thinking
he
wasnt
worth
the
bother
.

Theres
definitely
a
lesson
there
.

If
you
are
travelling
on
your
own
try
to
blend
in
,
not
get
noticed
(
which
is
difficult
when
you
are
carrying
a
great
big
camera
)
,
look
as
if
you
belong
there
and
you
know
what
you
are
doing
.

Dont
associate
with
idiots
and
canon
fodder
.

What
do
I
mean
by
that
?

Well
I
was
travelling
with
friends
by
train
once
through
the
south
of
france	B	france	France	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France	000	000
.

It
was
early
in
the
morning
and
as
we
waited
to
get
off
the
train
we
were
approached
by
a
guy
wearing
just
his
socks
,
boxers
and
t-shirt
.

‘
Do
you
speak
english
?
’

‘
No
we
dont
’

‘
Ok
ok
,
do
you
know
anyone
who
does
’

‘
we
are
only
kidding
you
’

‘
oh
ok
,
do
you
know
where
the
rest
of
the
train
is
?
’

‘
what
?
’

‘
the
rest
of
the
train
,
I
woke
up
during
the
night
,
went
to
the
toilet
,
fell
asleep
in
the
toilet
,
woke
up
,
went
back
and
the
rest
of
the
train
wasnt
there
’

‘
Oh
you
mean
the
back
half
of
the
train
that
was
on
its
way
to
Madrid
’

‘
Yes
’

‘
Its
probably
in
Madrid
’

‘
where
is
this
part
going
?
’

‘
Milan
we
think
but
we
are
getting
off
here
’

‘
If
I
get
off
here
do
you
think
my
mate
will
know
where
to
come
and
get
me
,
hes
got
the
passports
,
money
,
clothes
,
rucksacks
’

Now
at
some
point
you
have
to
feel
immense
pity
,
you
feel
like
helping
the
guy
out
and
taking
him
under
your
wing
.

Alternatively
you
can
just
run
away
and
remind
yourself
of
Darwins
theories
.

One
other
time
I
was
on
a
bus
in
Rome	B	Rome	Rome	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome	000	000
and
this
girl
was
giving
her
what
I
assume
was
a
boyfriend
such
earache
at
such
a
high
volume
it
wasnt
hard
to
be
nosey
.

To
cut
the
long
story
short
they
had
been
walking
down
this
backstreet
in
Rome	B	Rome	Rome	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome	000	000
which
they
shouldnt
really
have
been
on
when
he
was
approached
by
a
beautiful
early
20s
woman
.

She
walked
right
up
to
him
with
a
big
kiss
and
started
to
fondle
his
nuts
(
and
I
dont
mean
peanuts
)
.

The
guy
of
course
was
just
happy
to
go
along
for
the
ride
but
suddenly
she
walked
off
when
another
female
friend
appeared
.

The
girlfriend
at
the
time
was
too
gobsmacked
to
say
anything
and
our
hero
was
in
no
fit
state
to
argue
.

That
was
until
he
discovered
that
his
bumbag
(
fannypack
)
was
empty
and
hed
lost
their
money
,
passports
,
room
keys
,
everything
.

So
for
the
entire
bus
journey
back
to
the
centre
of
town
he
and
the
rest
of
the
bus
was
reminded
about
how
stupid
he
’d
been
.

I
cant
really
describe
the
look
on
his
face
,
he
was
taking
a
lot
of
abuse
and
whilst
he
showed
shame
and
embarrassment
there
was
still
a
trace
of
a
smile
on
his
face
.

So
let
that
be
a
lesson
to
you
all
,
either
hide
your
valuables
or
buy
a
shedload
of
cheap
wallets
from
china
on
ebay	B	ebay	EBay	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay	000	000
,
fill
them
with
newspaper
cuttings
and
get
a
cheap
flight
to
Rome	B	Rome	Rome	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome	000	000
and
have
the
week
of
your
life
.

So
what
has
all
this
got
to
do
with
photography
?

Well
I
did
say
at
the
start
,
do
as
I
say
,
not
as
I
do
.

I
’ll
go
back
to
a
recent
trip
to
Rome	B	Rome	Rome	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome	000	000
.

On
the
last
night
it
was
a
clear
evening
so
I
thought
I
’d
head
to
the
Vatican	B	Vatican	Vatican_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City	000	000
and
get
some
late
night
shots
of
St	B	St Peters Square	Saint_Peter's_Square	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter's_Square	000	000
Peters	I	St Peters Square	Saint_Peter's_Square	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter's_Square	000	000
Square	I	St Peters Square	Saint_Peter's_Square	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter's_Square	000	000
with
maybe
a
few
people
ghosting
through
the
shots
but
try
to
get
most
without
people
.

So
I
got
to
St	B	St Peters Square	Saint_Peter's_Square	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter's_Square	000	000
Peters	I	St Peters Square	Saint_Peter's_Square	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter's_Square	000	000
Square	I	St Peters Square	Saint_Peter's_Square	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Peter's_Square	000	000
and
as
I
was
travelling
light
I
’d
no
tripod
,
so
just
put
my
backpack
on
the
ground
and
put
the
camera
on
the
top
.

It
was
a
still
night
so
wind
movement
wouldnt
be
a
problem
so
I
just
attached
the
cable
release
to
the
camera
and
lay
down
behind
it
all
to
see
through
the
viewfinder
to
line
it
all
up
.

At
this
point
I
heard
some
footsteps
behind
me
and
thought
,
oh
crap

The
Timberwolves	B	Timberwolves	Minnesota_Timberwolves	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves	000	000
yesterday
signed
Bonzi	B	Bonzi Wells	Bonzi_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonzi_Wells	000	000
Wells	I	Bonzi Wells	Bonzi_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonzi_Wells	000	000
,
who
has
n't
played
in
the
NBA	B	NBA	National_Basketball_Association	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association	000	000
since
2008
.

Wells	B	Wells	Bonzi_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonzi_Wells	000	000
,
who
is
variously
described
as
a
"
veteran
presence
"
and
a
"
hothead
,
"
may
never
see
a
minute
in
a
regular-season
game
for
Minnesota	B	Minnesota	Minnesota_Timberwolves	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves	000	000
,
instead
functioning
as
a
camp
/
practice
player
.

Wells	B	Wells	Bonzi_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonzi_Wells	000	000
has
been
in
camp
for
several
days
,
but
was
only
yesterday
cleared
by
FIBA	B	FIBA	FIBA	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA	000	000
to
sign
a
contract
.

That
said
,
it
's
a
confusing
signing
,
to
say
the
least
.

After
the
jump
,
the
top
ten
reasons
the
Wolves	B	Wolves	Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.	000	000
signed
Wells	B	Wells	Bonzi_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonzi_Wells	000	000
.

The
team
was
looking
for
someone
who
remembers
the
Ford	B	Ford Administration	Gerald_Ford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford	000	000
Administration	I	Ford Administration	Gerald_Ford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford	000	000
.

Other
slightly
older
shooting
guards
,
like
George	B	George Gervin	George_Gervin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gervin	000	000
Gervin	I	George Gervin	George_Gervin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gervin	000	000
,
were
unavailable
.

The
team
has
been
looking
to
fill
the
all-important
"
make
obscene
gestures
at
fans
"
role
.

Having
not
played
since
2008
,
he
wo
n't
have
seen
how
bad
the
Wolves	B	Wolves	Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.	000	000
have
been
lately
in
person
.

Everybody
else
wanted
to
be
paid
in
money
.

The
Wolves	B	Wolves	Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.	000	000
just
wanted
somebody
new
for
Nik
Pekovic
to
foul
in
practice
.

Rick	B	Rick Adelman	Rick_Adelman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Adelman	000	000
Adelman	I	Rick Adelman	Rick_Adelman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Adelman	000	000
needed
someone
he
can
trust
to
wear
a
wire
into
the
locker
room
.

David	B	David Kahn	David_Kahn_(sports_executive)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kahn_(sports_executive)	000	000
Kahn	I	David Kahn	David_Kahn_(sports_executive)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kahn_(sports_executive)	000	000
just
realized
he
managed
to
construct
an
entire
roster
without
a
shooting
guard
,
and
got
desperate
.

Wells	B	Wells	Bonzi_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonzi_Wells	000	000
can
teach
some
young
players
the
various
lessons
he
's
learned
during
his
NBA	B	NBA	National_Basketball_Association	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association	000	000
career
,
such
as
"
what
to
do
if
an
opponent
blocks
the
team
bus
in
the
parking
lot
and
comes
after
you
with
a
gun
.
"

Nobody
could
find
Antoine
Walker
's
phone
number

aside
a
gaggle
of
ultra-talented
folks
in
an
unusual
biopic
of

an
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
original
.

Now
,
to
promote
the
film
in
a
sort
of
unprecedented

publicity
stunt
if
you
will
,
Kevin	B	Kevin	Kevin_Spacey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey	000	000
,
who
actually
sings
all
the

songs
in
the
film
,
has
taken
his
"
act
"
on
the
road
-

literally
-
along
with
an
18
piece
orchestra
and
back-up
singers

ala

review
Darin	B	Darin	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
himself
would
be
proud
of
.

Mr.

Spacey	B	Spacey	Kevin_Spacey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey	000	000
,
who
is
proving
himself
to
be
an
equal
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
original
,

apparently
knows
no
bounds
in
his
creativity
,
and
passion
for

taking
life
and
by
the
horns
and
parlaying
his
all-access
"
fame
"

card
into
vast
experiences
.

With

this
remarkable
traveling
old-school
high-end
lounge
act
,
Kevin	B	Kevin	Kevin_Spacey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey	000	000

will
visit
several
cities
bringing
the
love
and
music
to
a
few

sold
out
venues
.

But
,
the
show
's
recent
stop
into
the
Wiltern	B	Wiltern Theater	Pellissier_Building_and_Wiltern_Theatre	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellissier_Building_and_Wiltern_Theatre	000	000
Theater	I	Wiltern Theater	Pellissier_Building_and_Wiltern_Theatre	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellissier_Building_and_Wiltern_Theatre	000	000
,
in
Los	B	Los Angeles	Los_Angeles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles	000	000
Angeles	I	Los Angeles	Los_Angeles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles	000	000
,
had
a
special
glow
.

The
audience
here

included
Dodd
Darin
,
Bobby	B	Bobby	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
's
son
with
Sandra	B	Sandra Dee	Sandra_Dee	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Dee	000	000
Dee	I	Sandra Dee	Sandra_Dee	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Dee	000	000
,
along
with
his

wife
and
daughter
,
as
well
as
Steve
Blauner
,
Bobby	B	Bobby Darin	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
Darin	I	Bobby Darin	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
's
personal

manager
and
dear
friend
.

And
the
elite
guests
were
obviously
moved

by
the
music
they
are
so
close
to
being
embraced
and
appreciated

by
a
live
,
adoring
,
knowing
,
audience
again
.

This

was
a
Darin	B	Darin	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
audience
.

They
were
buzzing
as
Kevin	B	Kevin	Kevin_Spacey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey	000	000
rocked
the
rafters

with
his
electric
performance
.

The
verdict
is
in
,
this
Spacey	B	Spacey	Kevin_Spacey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey	000	000

fella
is
one
helluva
talent
.

And
there
's
was
no
sign
of
the
"
movie

star
.
"

He
was
an
entertainer
;
he
joked
,
he
sang
,
he
soft

shoed
about
,
and
even
played
the
harmonica
for
a
few
songs
.

The

show
is
as
good
as
any
"
professional
"
singer
's
.

This

is
one
actor-come-singer
that
could
quit
his
day
job
-
easily
.

Spacey
,

lead
by
Darin
's
own
musical
director
Roger

Kellaway
,
belted
out
over
a
dozen
songs
particularly
Darin-esque
.

And
as
tribute
,
Mr.
Spacey	B	Spacey	Kevin_Spacey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey	000	000
even
worked
in
many
recognizable
asides

and
"
Bobby-isms
"
into
the
show
's
routine
;
none
more

charming
then
an
old
schtick
Darin	B	Darin	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
liked
to
"
loosen
the
crowd

up
with
"
about
a
drunk
at
a
Hollywood	B	Hollywood	Hollywood	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood	000	000

impersonating
all

sorts
of
famous
folks
.

gave

an

signature
songs

.

For
Darin	B	Darin	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
fans
,
like
myself
,
it
was
positively
magical
to
hear

these
songs
live
and
with
a
full
orchestra
.

To
ad
to
the
treasure

trove
of
auditory
bliss
,
Spacey	B	Spacey	Kevin_Spacey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey	000	000
shared
if
the
listeners
were
enjoying

the
stylings
of
the
music
this
evening
,
as
well
as
on
the
soundtrack

and
in
the
film
,
they
had
Dodd
Darin
and
Steve
Blauner
to
thank
.

They
had
sent
him
Bobby	B	Bobby	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
's
original
charts
and
notes
on
how
he

wanted
the
songs
played
and
these
were
those
interpretations
.

Though

the
evening
's
spotlight
was
firmly
following
Spacey	B	Spacey	Kevin_Spacey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey	000	000
,
the
event

was
designed
to
"
shine
the
light
back
on
Bobby	B	Bobby Darin	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
Darin	I	Bobby Darin	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
.
"

And
it
shined
like
a
beacon
.

Mission
accomplished
.

Song
after

song
,
many
written
by
Darin	B	Darin	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
,
were
brilliantly
orchestrated
as

Spacey	B	Spacey	Kevin_Spacey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey	000	000
showed
his
genuine
abilities
for
crooning
and
playing
with

an
audience
.

When
he
sang
Darin	B	Darin	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
's
'
A
Simple
Song
Of
Freedom
'
,

the
audience
was
cheering
and
seemed
to
agree
that
the
once-again

timely
anti-war
song
has
just
as
important
a
message
today
as

when
Darin	B	Darin	Bobby_Darin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Darin	000	000
wrote
it
in
protest
of
the
Viet	B	Viet Nam	Vietnam	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam	000	000
Nam	I	Viet Nam	Vietnam	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam	000	000
fiasco
.

Spacey	B	Spacey	Kevin_Spacey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Spacey	000	000
's

created
a
beautiful
film
in
Beyond	B	Beyond the Sea	Beyond_the_Sea_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Sea_(film)	000	000
the	I	Beyond the Sea	Beyond_the_Sea_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Sea_(film)	000	000
Sea	I	Beyond the Sea	Beyond_the_Sea_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Sea_(film)	000	000
,
and
know
now

as
he
swings
across
the
country
with
this
delightful
ensemble
,

this
incredible
and
unique
force
of
creative
diversity
,
has
managed

to
excel
within
yet
another
side
of
his
many
talents
.

The
shows

are
sold
out
-
but
there
's
always
someone
lurking
around
the
stage

door
with
a
ticket
to
sell
.

I
suggest
you
bring
a
bag-o-cash
and

negotiate
well
-
'cause
this
is
one
show
you
do
n't
want

to
miss
.

If
you
just
ca
n't
get
to
the
show
?

Get
over
and
purchase

The
famous
Nepali	B	Nepali	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
poet
Laxmi	B	Laxmi Prasad Devkota	Laxmi_Prasad_Devkota	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxmi_Prasad_Devkota	000	000

described
Nepal	B	Nepal	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
as
“
Sundaar
,
Shanta
,
Bishal
”
-
beautiful
,
peaceful
and
huge
or
‘
endless
’
.

If
you
wish
to
experience
the
words
of
the
famous
poet
,
pick
up
your
bag
,
put
on
your
walking
shoes
and
set
out
towards
Langtang	B	Langtang National Park	Langtang_National_Park	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langtang_National_Park	000	000

.

The
pristine
forest
,
the
clear
rivers
,
waterfalls
and
lakes
,
the
colourful
flowers
,
wildlife
and
birds
,
make
every
step
you
take
worth
while
.

Add
to
this
the
food
,
the
local
drinks
,
the
music
and
cultural
dances
,
the
monasteries
and
the
chortens
and
you
will
forget
the
effort
you
put
in
to
get
to
these
amazing
sites
.

It
is
also
a
perfect
venue
to
launch
the
“
academic
trek
”
in
which
people
can
get
a
real
exposure
to
climate
change
,
its
impact
,
adaptation
strategies
and
mitigation
measures
.

Portions
of
the
trail
we
walked
on
could
be
part
of
the
proposed
Great
Himalayan
Trail
(
GHT
)
that
has
been
designed
not
just
as
a
tourism
product
but
will
serve
to
provide
connectivity
for
all
settlements
at
the
foothills
of
the
Himalayas	B	Himalayas	Himalayas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas	000	000
.

It
will
form
an
integral
part
of
Nepal	B	Nepal	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
’s
adaptation
plan
against
climate
change
.

All
renewables
-
solar
and
hydro

At
each
of
the
lodges
and
tea
houses
that
we
had
our
meals
or
spent
the
night
,
there
was
either
solar
power
or
clean
hydro
power
.

The
area
is
fortunate
to
have
three
hydro
power
plants
-
Devighat
,
Trishuli
and
the
Chilime	B	Chilime	Chilime	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilime	000	000
with
potential
for
many
more
.

The
world
is
today
putting
out
ninety
million
tones
of
carbon
dioxide
into
the
atmosphere
each
day
.

Under
normal
conditions
,
the
atmosphere
should
contain
only
350
parts
per
million
of
carbon
dioxide
,
but
today
has
reached
387
.

Rasuwa	B	Rasuwa district	Rasuwa_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasuwa_District	000	000
district	I	Rasuwa district	Rasuwa_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasuwa_District	000	000
can
easily
become
renewable
energy
self
sufficient
and
‘
sell
’
the
surplus
to
Kathmandu	B	Kathmandu	Kathmandu	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathmandu	000	000
and
launch
a
domestic
carbon
trade
mechanism
.

As
it
takes
a
lot
of
human
effort
to
move
goods
up
and
down
the
slopes
of
Rasuwa
,
electricity
powered
ropeways
can
be
a
real
possibility
here
.

Biogas
plants
are
also
getting
popular
in
the
villages
in
the
south
of
the
district
.

Red
,
white
and
blue

Each
day
we
saw
red
and
white
rhododendron
flowers
along
the
trail
against
the
clear
blue
sky
.

It
did
rain
and
it
did
snow
,
but
it
cleared
up
quickly
to
give
us
spectacular
views
of
the
flora
and
landscape
of
the
area
.

Red	B	Red	Red	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red	000	000
,
white
and
blue
are
the
colors
that
make
up
the
Nepali	B	Nepali	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
national
flag
and
it
is
Nepal
Tourism
year
.

We
all
carried
the
flag
,
sticking
out
of
each
of
our
backpacks
as
we
climbed
up
and
walked
down
the
slopes
of
the
Himalayas	B	Himalayas	Himalayas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas	000	000
.

Recently
there
has
been
some
debate
as
to
whether
we
should
change
the
flag
.

As
you
walk
through
Langtang	B	Langtang	Langtang_National_Park	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langtang_National_Park	000	000
,
the
blue
becomes
the
sky
and
the
numerous
rivers
,
the
white
becomes
the
purity
of
the
glaciers
and
the
rhododendron
,
the
red
is
the
rhododendron
and
the
blood
of
the
entrepreneurial
spirit
of
the
people
;
and
as
long
as
the
sun
and
moon
comes
up
each
day
over
the
ridge
to
the
east
,
this
country
will
be
there
.

The
first
night
of
our
trek
,
we
were
greeted
by
a
full
moon
.

Red	B	Red	Red	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red	000	000
,
blue
and
white
also
make
up
the
flag
of
the
USA	B	USA	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
whose
60
years
in
Nepal	B	Nepal	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
we
were
celebrating
.

Climate
change

The
theme
of
the
trek
was
to
observe
the
impact
of
climate
change
and
to
see
what
efforts
were
underway
to
help
and
enable
local
people
to
adapt
to
these
changes
.

We
all
had
mixed
feelings
at
the
end
of
the
trek
.

On
the
one
hand
climate
change
and
its
effects
were
real
.

We
heard
of
changing
rainfall
patterns
to
new
species
of
plants
that
were
killing
local
livestock
.

We
were
told
about
change
in
habitat
for
local
endangered
species
of
flora
and
fauna
and
the
unreliability
of
water
supplies
from
traditional
sources
.

A
local
woman
had
even
composed
a
poem
about
climate
change
.

What
was
really
heart
warming
was
to
see
how
local
communities
had
begun
to
create
a
seed
bank
to
protect
local
gene
varieties
of
crops
.

We
saw
how
renewable
energy
sources
were
being
harnessed
to
reduce
pressure
on
the
local
forest
such
as
biogas
.

We
were
delighted
to
see
so
much
production
of
‘
organic
’
food
and
to
meet
young
people
who
were
well
educated
about
the
complexity
of
climate
change
.

Trout
and
strawberry

Rural
Nepali	B	Nepali	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
villages
,
are
not
just
about
maize
and
soybeans
or
millet
and
buckwheat
anymore
,
but
have
created
good
food
out
of
local
stingy
nettle
or
“
sisnoo
.
”

When
prepared
and
served
in
style
,
the
local
dish
can
be
quite
a
delight
.

Further
,
it
is
also
a
pleasant
surprise
to
see
so
many
framers
have
begun
strawberry
farming
in
the
area
.

Others
are
big
into
the
Himalayan
Rainbow
Trout
farming
.

The
people
are
so
enterprising
and
will
do
well
against
all
odds
.

One
does
see
“
ready
made
noodles
”
of
different
brands
everywhere
along
with
carbonated
drinks
.

We
do
not
need
to
do
much
except
give
the
trekker
a
choice
and
educate
them
about
the
value
creation
in
the
local
economy
if
we
eat
local
food
.

The
milk
and
the
cheese
of
the
local
areas
are
of
really
good
quality
.

Everywhere
we
also
had
yogurt
,
alcoholic
drinks
made
from
locally
grown
millet
which
were
offered
as
a
welcome
gesture
in
silver
decorated
cups
and
served
from
traditional
decanters
.

have
been

the
people
of
Nepal	B	Nepal	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
for
sixty
years
now
.

The
US
Agency
for
International
Development
USAID
has
helped
so
many
Nepalis	B	Nepalis	Demographics_of_Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Nepal	000	000
to
acquire
higher
education
and
various
trainings
.

(

)
has
been
helping
protect
Nepal	B	Nepal	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
’s
globally
unique
flora
and
fauna
for
fifty
years
.

The
green
hike
,
green
planet
trek
was
part
of
these
anniversary
celebrations
.

The
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
people
have
given
so
much
to
Nepal	B	Nepal	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
including
highways
,
higher
education
institutes
,
ropeways
,
and
so
much
more
.

WWF	B	WWF	World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature	000	000
has
helped
Nepal	B	Nepal	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
become
a
global
leader
in
conservation
of
rich
flora
and
fauna
.

Both
deserve
our
gratitude
and
commitment
to
do
more
for
ourselves
as
Nepalis	B	Nepalis	Demographics_of_Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Nepal	000	000
.

We
need
to
take
ownership
of
our
challenges
and
begin
to
become
proactive
.

Climate
change
,
adaptation
and
mitigation
could
very
well
be
an
area
where
Nepal	B	Nepal	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
could
take
the
lead
.

We
watched
the
final
game
of
a
local
volleyball
tournament
and
gave
away
the
WWF	B	WWF	World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature	000	000
sponsored
Red
Panda
Trophy
and
medals
to
the
winning
team
!

Rasuwa
Gaddi
to
Galchi

The
trade
volume
between
India	B	India	India	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India	000	000
and
China	B	China	China	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China	000	000
in
2008
had
exceeded
a
value
of
US
$
50
billion
.

The
question
that
many
ask
is
,
can
this
go
through
Nepal	B	Nepal	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
?

We
do
need
to
be
organized
if
Nepal	B	Nepal	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
is
going
to
take
advantage
of
this
instead
of
just
a
handful
of
“
clever
people
”
as
in
the
past
.

The
Rasuwa
Gaddhi
to
Galchi
highway
is
nearing
completion
with
support
from
the
Asian	B	Asian Development Bank	Asian_Development_Bank	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Development_Bank	000	000
Development	I	Asian Development Bank	Asian_Development_Bank	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Development_Bank	000	000
Bank	I	Asian Development Bank	Asian_Development_Bank	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Development_Bank	000	000
(
ADB	B	ADB	Asian_Development_Bank	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Development_Bank	000	000
)
.

We
drove
back
along
this
road
and
began
a
conversation
centered
around
how
this
may
serve
as
a
green
corridor
between
Nepal	B	Nepal	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
and
Tibet	B	Tibet	Tibet	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet	000	000
,
China	B	China	China	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China	000	000
that
will
enhance
conservation
and
management
of
natural
resources
.

Local
people
in
Rasuwa
aspire
to
send
fresh
“
organic
”
food
each
day
into
Tibet	B	Tibet	Tibet	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet	000	000
.

There
is
talk
of
a
“
green
special
economic
zone
”
in
the
area
as
well
.

We
have
to
make
sure
that
illegal
wildlife
body
parts
do
not
travel
on
this
road
.

We
must
also
ensure
that
the
“
clean
”
river
that
currently
flows
along
the
highway
does
not
suffer
the
same
fate
as
others
in
the
past
.

Just
do
it

Langtang	B	Langtang	Langtang	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langtang	000	000
is
waiting
for
you
.

There
can
not
be
an
excuse
not
to
go
enjoy
and
pamper
yourself
.

It
is
a
good
place
to
mix
work
and
holiday
as
well
.

Over
the
next
weeks
and
months
,
many
pilgrims
will
be
going
up
to
Gosaikunda	B	Gosaikunda	Gosaikunda	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosaikunda	000	000
.

Choose
when
and
how
you
want
to
go
,
but
do
go
!

Authority
official
Barker
thinks
seven
or
eight
months
is
plenty
of
time
for
the
environmental
process
,
but
Moore	B	Moore	Maya_Moore	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Moore	000	000
is
n't
sure
.
"

Those
EIRs
are
going
to
raise
a
lot
of
questions
,
"
he
said
.
"

If
that
's
a
necessary
condition
for
proceeding
,
that
could
hold
things
up
.
"

The
EIRs
also
will
form
the
basis
for
the
rail
authority
's
final
selection
of
a
route
for
the
tracks
between
Fresno	B	Fresno	Fresno_County,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno_County,_California	000	000
and
Bakersfield	B	Bakersfield	Bakersfield,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California	000	000
.

Until
that
happens
,
the
authority
can
not
seek
or
award
bids
for
construction
or
even
start
buying
the
land
it
needs
for
the
tracks.Engineers
and
planners
also
are
working
on
the
preliminary
design
for
the
system.By
the
time
the
authority
expects
to
start
soliciting
bids
from
contractors
--
late
this
year
or
in
early
2012
--
this
work
is
expected
to
be
at
least
30
%
complete.Contractors
would
complete
the
design
and
build
the
system
.

Under
the
federal
grant
agreement
,
those
design-build
contracts
must
be
awarded
by
September
2012
.

Along
the
way
,
the
state
must
submit
detailed
plans
to
federal
officials
for
how
right
of
way
will
be
acquired
,
how
roads
and
utilities
will
be
moved
,
and
how
hazardous
materials
will
be
handled.But
all
of
that
still
depends
on
funding
,
which
is
not
yet
pinned
down
and
faces
its
own
obstacles.Money
mattersGov
.

Jerry	B	Jerry Brown	Jerry_Brown	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown	000	000
Brown	I	Jerry Brown	Jerry_Brown	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown	000	000
and
the
state
Legislature
must
agree
to
allocate
money
from
Prop.
1A
to
match
the
federal
funds
.

Barker
said
the
authority
will
seek
its
first
installments
of
money
in
the
state
's
2012-13
budget.Prop
.

1A
requires
that
an
independent
panel
of
transportation
and
rail
experts
approve
budget
requests
before
any
bonds
are
sold.The
same
panel
late
last
year
issued
a
report
questioning
the
authority
's
lack
of
a
detailed
financing
and
income
plan
,
lack
of
a
business
model
for
operating
and
managing
the
system
,
and
lack
of
staffing
to
oversee
the
project.Some
legislators
also
have
criticized
the
authority
's
preliminary
estimates
of
revenues
and
ridership
as
"
unrealistic
.
"

One
example
:
a
projection
of
as
many
as
102,700
riders
daily
on
the
statewide
system
,
including
4,500
boardings
daily
in
Fresno	B	Fresno	Fresno_County,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresno_County,_California	000	000
.
"

Obviously
there
are
challenges
and
questions
,
and
the
onus
is
on
us
to
address
those
questions
,
"
Barker
said
.
"

By
the
time
we
bring
our
budget
request
,
we
'll
have
to
have
all
these
questions
answered
.
"

Should
the
Legislature	B	Legislature	Legislature	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature	000	000
reject
the
budget
request
,
"
that
would
be
saying
,
'
No
,
we
do
n't
want
high-speed
rail
,
'
"
Barker
added
.
"

That
would
be
telling
the
federal
government
to
take
back
the
$
2.5
billion
and
saying
we
do
n't
want
it
.
"

If
the
armful
of
"
ifs
"
are
accomplished
--
if
the
rail
authority
meets
the
deadline
for
environmental
review
,
if
it
gets
money
from
the
Legislature	B	Legislature	Legislature	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature	000	000
,
and
if
it
awards
construction
contracts
in
time
--
then
it
's
on
to
the
dirty
work.Shovels
in
the
groundThe
rail
authority
suggests
that
building
the
segments
between
Merced	B	Merced	Merced,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merced,_California	000	000
and
Bakersfield	B	Bakersfield	Bakersfield,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California	000	000
will
create
as
many
as
80,000
temporary
construction
jobs
between
2012
and
2017
.

But
because
only
30
%
of
the
engineering
is
expected
to
be
completed
on
the
project
by
the
time
contracts
are
awarded
next
year
,
much
work
will
remain
on
the
drawing
board
until
perhaps
2013
and
2014
.
"

We
wo
n't
have
10,000
hard
hats
on
the
ground
laying
rail
in
September
2012
,
"
said
Barker
.
"

Final
engineering
will
be
the
first
phase
of
work
being
done
.
"

The
first
work
that
the
public
would
see
is
likely
to
be
land
acquisition
,
clearing
property
and
demolishing
structures
in
the
path
of
the
tracks
,
said
John
Popoff
,
an
engineer
on
the
authority
's
management
team
.

The

Unclassifiable

Sin	B	Sin	Sin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin	000	000
is
one
of
those
words
that
has
all
but
disappeared
from
our
everyday
vocabulary
.

To
have
a
concept
of
sin
,
you
need
to
believe
in
an
old-fashioned
,
fire-and-brimstone
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
,
keeping
a
tally
on
our
moral
progress
in
this
world
.

Yet
sin
,
when
we
pause
to
think
about
it
,
remains
a
powerful
idea
,
if
only
because
it
suggests
a
set
of
external
limits
and
a
personal
accountability
that
we
often
boast
of
leaving
behind
.

So
a
book
titled
The
New
Sins
is
bound
to
be
provocative
,
and
this
one
,
printed
by
an
Icelandic	B	Icelandic	Iceland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland	000	000
maker
of
Bibles	B	Bibles	Bible	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible	000	000
,
comes
clad
in
the
foil-blocked
,
mock
leather
trappings
of
an
authentic
religious
tract
.

The
cover
records
that
it
has
been
‘

,
and
his
‘
new
sins
’
mix
humour
with
semi-serious
intent
in
much
the
same
way
.

According
to
Byrne	B	Byrne	Talking_Heads	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads	000	000
’s
oddball
reasoning
,
some
of
it
modified
from
real
religious
texts
,
everything
we
mistakenly
believe
to
be
virtuous
--
charity
,
sense
of
humour
,
beauty
,
thrift
,
ambition
,
hope
,
intelligence/knowledge
,
contentment
,
sweetness
,
honesty
and
cleanliness
--
is
a
sin
of
the
most
insidious
kind
.

Byrne	B	Byrne	Talking_Heads	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads	000	000
’s
tone
of
religiose
exhortation
is
impressively
sustained
,
but
it
’s
the
nicely
judged
visual
treatment
of
his
questionable
arguments
that
ultimately
makes
the
book
.

The
text
,
in
English	B	English	England	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England	000	000
and
Spanish	B	Spanish	Spain	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain	000	000
,
is
illustrated
by
80
of
his
photographs
,
deadpan
depictions
of
objects
,
surfaces
,
quirky
details
--
contentment
is
a
plant
trimmed
into
the
shape
of
rabbit
,
ambition
a
swarm
of
ants
,
hell
the
empty
corner
of
an
office
.

Byrne	B	Byrne	Talking_Heads	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads	000	000
calls
the
pictures
‘
software
programs
for
the
eye
’
and
observes
that
the
text
is
merely
a
distraction
,
a
device
to
make
you
spend
longer
looking
at
the
images
.

Byrne	B	Byrne	Talking_Heads	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads	000	000
asked
Dave	B	Dave Eggers	Dave_Eggers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers	000	000

to
design
The
New
Sins
.

Eggers	B	Eggers	Dave_Eggers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers	000	000
showed
him
examples
of
Bibles	B	Bibles	Bible	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible	000	000
in
his
own
collection
,
and
his
page
designs
,
each
one
framed
by
red
and
black
box
rules
,
have
a
kind
of
artless
elegance
.

Headings
in
italic
capitals
and
various
arbitrary
key
words
--
‘
better
fiction
’
,
‘
invisible
to
the
giver
’
,
‘
hydraulic
pipes
’
--
are
picked
out
in
red
.

Some
passages
have
marginal
notes
in
smaller
type
similar
to
those
in
early
Bibles
.

Where
Byrne	B	Byrne	Talking_Heads	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads	000	000
’s
previous
book
,
Your
Action
World
,
designed
by
Stefan	B	Stefan Sagmeister	Stefan_Sagmeister	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Sagmeister	000	000
Sagmeister	I	Stefan Sagmeister	Stefan_Sagmeister	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Sagmeister	000	000
,
laboured
its
plasticky
ironies
in
a
way
that
some
found
too
obvious
,
The
New
Sins
infiltrates
the
mind
with
a
subtler
touch
.

As
an
object
,
it
is
small
enough
to
carry
in
the
pocket
and
dip
into
and
to
try
out
,
as
Byrne	B	Byrne	Talking_Heads	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads	000	000
himself
has
done
,
on
people
who
do
n’t
know
he
wrote
it
.

From
his
early
collaborations
with
M&C
o
,
Byrne	B	Byrne	Talking_Heads	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads	000	000
has
made
astute
use
of
graphic
design
,
but
that
does
n’t
stop
him
consigning
designers
,
along
with
website
managers
and
relief
workers
,
to
the
upper
levels
of
hell
.

‘
Their
crime
?

Hubris
.

Their
punishment
?

Equality
.

Everyone
looks
cool
,
fashionable
and
absolutely
identical
--
well-dressed
,
handsome
and
completely
boring
.

Everything
is
perfect
and
unbearable
.
’

The
most
appealing
thing
about
The
New
Sins
is
the
way
that
it
resists
definition
.

Coming
from
pop
music
,
Byrne	B	Byrne	Talking_Heads	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_Heads	000	000
has
a
light
touch
and
few
have
proved
smarter
,
over
the
years
,
in
using
the
medium
as
a
vehicle
for
diverse
artistic
ends
.

You
could
see
The
New
Sins
as
an
artist
’s
book
but
,
despite
its
weighty
themes
,
it
has
none
of
the
portentousness
of
the
genre
and
it
is
easy
to
buy
.

It
has
a
real
subject
,
and
many
self-authored
design
projects
look
unfocused
and
aimless
by
comparison
.

During
the
Valencia	B	Valencia	Valencia_CF	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia_CF	000	000
biennial
,
it
was
placed
in
hotel
rooms
,
like
a
Gideon	B	Gideon Bible	Gideons_International	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideons_International	000	000
Bible	I	Gideon Bible	Gideons_International	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideons_International	000	000
,
for
new
sinners
to
discover
.

‘
You
are
floating
and
will
seek
safe
harbor

Materials
Engineer

Her
advice
for
university
leavers
is
to
go
for
first-class
honours
,
and
for
a
job
that
interests
you
.

‘
Be
enthusiastic
in
the
interview
process
,
and
get
involved
in
groups
or
societies
like
MatES
--
it
gives
you
more
experience
you
can
draw
on
in
the
interview
.

‘
Choose
a
job
based
on
what
you
're
interested
in
,
not
on
what
you
think
you
should
be
.

‘
The
auto
industry
is
hardly
the
most
stable
sector
around
,
and
yet
I
chose
to
be
here
because
I
had
a
keen
interest
.

‘
Now
I
'm
loving
it
.

I
get
paid
to
muck
around
with
cars
.

I
doubt
if
I
'd
chosen
a
job
based
on
money
I
'd
be
as
happy
I
am
now
--
maybe
close
,
but
I
'm
sceptical
about
how
long
that
would
last

‘
The
culture

a
close-knit

were
easily
accessible

always
willing

extensive

.

On
November
12
,
2011
a
dozen
sidewalk
evangelists
conducted
a
neighborhood
awareness
campaign
at
Quintana
’s
residence
.

The
campaign
began
in
the
parking
lot
of
St	B	St Paul	Paul_the_Apostle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle	000	000
Paul	I	St Paul	Paul_the_Apostle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle	000	000

first
marched
through
the
Quintana
neighborhood
and
then
stood
at
the
intersection
of
the
street
as
hundreds
of
people
drove
by
to
attend
a
wedding
mass
across
the
street
.

One
awareness
campaign
participant
passed
out
flyers
to
passers-by
.

At
about
2:30
pm
,
the
neighbors
across
the
street
returned
to
their
home
and
began
to
confront
the
street
evangelists
claiming
that
the
signs
depicting
graphic
representations
of
aborted
children
were
offensive
.

José
Quintana
was
not
present
during
the
campaign
.

At
several
points
,
the
Quintana
family
and
some
teenage
boys
who
are
friends
of
the
Quintanas
began
to
angrily
confront
the
street
evangelists
saying
that
the
demonstrators
had
no
right
to
be
in
a
“
restricted
neighborhood
.
”

The
police
were
called
and
immediately
explained
that
they
were
acting
as
peace
officers
and
not
taking
sides
.

They
also
explained
to
all
involved
that
it
is
the
right
of
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
to
assemble
and
speak
in
a
public
right
of
way
.

As
Deanna
Waller
messaged
from
the
event
,
“
Today
we
were
spit
at
,
cursed
at
,
kicked
at
,
called
names
,
had
mulch
thrown
on
us
and
sprinklers
turned
on
us
for
Jesus	B	Jesus	Jesus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus	000	000

All
in

work

Wonder
what
tomorrow
will
bring
?

Reversing
Roe
:
The
Norma
McCorvey
Story
(
DVD
)

In
1969
,
a
pregnant
21
year
old
Norma	B	Norma McCorvey	Norma_McCorvey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_McCorvey	000	000
McCorvey	I	Norma McCorvey	Norma_McCorvey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_McCorvey	000	000
felt
abortion
was
her
only
answer
.

He
case
was
used
to
challenge
the
Texas	B	Texas	Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas	000	000
abortion
law
and
she
eventually
became
the
Jane	B	Jane Roe	Norma_McCorvey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_McCorvey	000	000
Roe	I	Jane Roe	Norma_McCorvey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_McCorvey	000	000

1973

Court	I	Supreme Court	Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	000	000

Wade	I	Roe v Wade	Roe_v._Wade	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade	000	000
.

She
never
had
an
abortion
,
but
instead
became
an
icon
in
the
national
abortion
debate
.

For
22
years
,
Norma	B	Norma McCorvey	Norma_McCorvey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_McCorvey	000	000
McCorvey	I	Norma McCorvey	Norma_McCorvey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_McCorvey	000	000
’s
life
was
a
battlefield
.

She
worked
inside
abortion
clinics
.

She
promoted
legalized
abortion
.

But
she
was
tormented
by
what
she
saw
and
felt
.

In
the
summer
of
1995
,
her
life
changed
forever
.

Through
the
friendship
of
a
pro-life
leader
and
a
special
invitation
from
a
7-year
old
child
,
Jane	B	Jane Roe	Norma_McCorvey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_McCorvey	000	000
Roe	I	Jane Roe	Norma_McCorvey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_McCorvey	000	000
finally

The
Real
Jesus
:
A
Defense
of
the
Historicity
and
Divinity
of
Christ
(
DVD
)

Who
is
the
Real
Jesus
?

Ever
since
the
dawn
of
modern
rationalism
,
skeptics
have
sought
to
use
textual
criticism
,
archeology
and
historical
reconstructions
to
uncover
the
“
historical
Jesus
”
--
a
wise
teacher
who
said
many
wonderful
things
,
but
fulfilled
no
prophecies
,
performed
no
miracles
and
certainly
did
not
rise
from
the
dead
in
triumph
over
sin
.

Over
the
past
100
years
,
however
,
startling
discoveries
in
biblical
archeology
and
scholarship
have
all
but
vanquished
the
faulty
assumptions
of
these
doubting
modernists
.

Regrettably
,
these
discoveries
have
often
been
ignored
by
the
skeptics
as
well
as
by
the
popular
media
.

As
a
result
,
the
liberal
view
still
holds
sway
in
universities
and
impacts
the
culture
and
even
much
of
the
church
.

The
Real
Jesus
explodes
the
myths
of
these
critics
and
the
movies
,
books
and
television
programs
that
have
popularized
their
views
.

Presented
in
ten
parts
--
perfect
for
individual
,
family
and
classroom
study
--
viewers
will
be
challenged
to
go
deeper
in
their
knowledge
of
Christ	B	Christ	Christ	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ	000	000
in
order
to
be
able
to
defend
their
faith
and
present
the
truth
to
a
skeptical
modern
world
--
that
the
Jesus	B	Jesus	Jesus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus	000	000
of
the
Gospels	B	Gospels	Gospel	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel	000	000
is
the
Jesus
of
history

These
shocking
eyewitness

what

,
these

on
the
abortion
issue
and
to
lead
people
toward
a
pro-life
position
.

The
Abortion
Matrix
:
Defeating
Child
Sacrifice
and
the
Culture
of
Death
(
DVD
)

Download
the
free
Study
Guide
!

Is
there
a
connection
between
pagan
religion
and
the
abortion
industry
?

This
powerful
presentation
traces
the
biblical
roots
of
child
sacrifice
and
then
delves
into
the
social
,
political
and
cultural
fall-out
that
this
sin
against
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
and
crime
against
humanity
has
produced
in
our
beleaguered
society
.

Conceived
as
a
sequel
and
update
to
the
1988
classic
,
The
Massacre
of
Innocence
,
the
new
title
,
The
Abortion
Matrix
,
is
entirely
fitting
.

It
not
only
references
abortion
’s
specific
target
--
the
sacred
matrix
where
human
beings
are
formed
in
the
womb
in
the
very
image
of
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
,
but
it
also
implies
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
,
a
matrix
of
seemingly
disparate
forces
that
are
driving
this
holocaust
.

The
occult
activity
surrounding
the
abortion
industry
is
exposed
with
numerous
examples
.

But
are
these
just
aberrations
,
bizarre
yet
anomalous
examples
of
abortionists
who
just
happen
to
have
ties
to

modern
day
witchcraft
?

Or
is
this
representative
of
something
deeper
,
more
sinister
and
even
endemic
to
the
entire
abortion
movement
?

As
the
allusion
to
the
film
of
over
a
decade
ago
suggests
,
the
viewer
may
learn
that
things
are
not
always
as
they
appear
to
be
.

The
Abortion
Matrix
reveals
the
reality
of
child-killing
and
strikes
the
proper
moral
chord
to
move
hearts
to
fulfill
the
biblical
responsibility
to
rescue
those
unjustly
sentenced
to
death
and
to
speak
for
those
who
can
not
speak
for
themselves

Go

Speak
(
DVD

With
“
preaching
to
the
lost
”
being
such
a
basic
foundation
of
Christianity	B	Christianity	Christianity	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity	000	000
,
why
do
many
in
the
church
seem
to
be
apathetic
on
this
issue
of
preaching
in
highways
and
byways
of
towns
and
cities
?

Is
it
biblical
to
stand
in
the
public
places
of
the
world
and
proclaim
the
gospel
,
regardless
if
people
want
to
hear
it
or
not
?

Does
the
Bible	B	Bible	Bible	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible	000	000
really
call
church
pastors
,
leaders
and
evangelists
to
proclaim
the
gospel
in
the
public
square
as
part
of
obedience
to
the
Great	B	Great Commission	Great_Commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Commission	000	000
Commission	I	Great Commission	Great_Commission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Commission	000	000
,
or
is
public
preaching
something
that
is
outdated
and
not
applicable
for
our
day
and
age
?

These
any
many
other
questions
are
answered
in

How
Fatalities
Occurred

The
one
man
instantly
killed
by
the
storm
was

Wilson
Mathewson
.

He
was
a
farmer
,
53
years
of
age
,
and
lived

about
three-quarters
of
a
mile
from
Long
Branch
.

With
his
wife
,
Mr.
Mathewson
had
stepped
from
a

car
that
had
carried
him
from
the
city
to
Long

Branch
.

They
were
both
in
the
trolley

station
at
Long
Branch
preparing
to
go
to
their

home
.

When
the
wind
caught
the
trolley

station
in
its
grasp
,
Mr.
Mathewson
was
carried

along
with
it
.

He
was
struck
by
the

timbers
.

His
body
was
caught
in
the
grip

of
the
tornado
and
carried
a
distance
of
about

100
feet
from
where
the
station
had
stood
.

He
was
found
on
a
hillside
and
died
before
help

reached
him
.

Dopp
was
in
his
car
,
which
was
at
the
Long

Branch
shop
.

When
the
storm
came
he
was

engaged
in
cleaning
the
front
window
in
order

that
he
might
have
a
better
view
of
the
tracks

when
the
trip
was
resumed
.

The
car
was
close
beside
the
waiting
room
,

and
when
it
crashed
down
the
roof
of
the

structure
crashed
into
the
car
.

Dopp
had

no
chance
to
escape
.

His
chest
and

were
crushed
.

He
was
rushed
to

and
then
taken
to

roof
.

When
the
storm

hit
the
building
Mr.
Chapman
tried
to
get
to
a

door
to
close
it
.

As
he
did
he
was
caught

beneath
the
falling
timbers
of
the
house
and

crushed
.

His
chest
was
crushed
and
he

received
internal
injuries
that
proved
fatal

tree
and
[

upon

his
cottage
,
carrying
the
motorboat
ten
feet
in

to
the
air
where
it
hung
by
the
rope
.

A
cottage
owned
by

Clarence
Dunn
was
completely
wrecked
.

This
cottage
was
about
100
feet
from
another

cottage
where
Mr.
Dunn
's
family
were
huddled
in

fear
as
trees
crashed
down
in
the
woods
about

hem
.

Trees
along
the
river
,
leaning
over
,

were
hurled
over
in
the
opposite
direction
.

Mr.
Dudley

was
struck
by
an
iron
flag
pole
which
broke
into

three
pieces
while
he
was
trying
to
fasten
a

motorboat
.

greenhouse
across

the
road
was
blown
to
pieces
.

Mowing

machines
were
carried
[

]
feet
by
the

wind
...
.

The
home
of
Thomas

E.
Bennett
was
torn
from
its
stone

foundation
and
carried
at
least
twenty
feet
.

Mr.
Bennett
and
his
wife
were
unhurt
.

He

tried
to
protect
her
from
heavy
beams
and
boards

that
fell
about
them
and
his
shoulder
was

dislocated
and
his
chest
injured
,
though
it
is

not
thought
seriously
.

Across
from
the

Bennett
's

Lewis
Keith
's

home
was
destroyed
and
the
aged
man
and
his

family
narrowly
escaped

of

William
Michaels
,

the
schoolhouse
and
other
buildings
to
say

nothing
of
those
that
are
unroofed
or
twisted
.

The
farmers
there
are
stared
in
the
face
by

ruin
.

Mr.
Chapman

was
the
only
one
downstairs
when
his
home
was

demolished
and
he
was
killed
.

His
family
and

friends
were
upstairs
and
were
only

comparatively
slightly

He
was

crushed
by
heavy
timbers
under
one
corner
of

evidently
been
trying
to

close
the
door
when

fell

Miss
Laura
Hazelmyre
,
a
guest
at

the
house
,
climbed
out
and
was
seen
standing
on

the
roof
covered
with
blood
.

She
had
saved

the
life
of
Edna
Odin
,
a
girl
of
12
,
by
throwing

her
out
of
the
window
though
how
or
why
she
did

it
she
does
not
know
.

Miss
Hazelmyre
was

bruised
and
lacerated
all
over
her
body
an
a

large
piece
was
torn
from
one
of
her
limbs
but

she
was
able
to
be
up
this
morning
and
to
limp

along
the
road
.

Miss
Hazlemyre
is
only

about
18
years
old
and

crazed
by
the
terrible
disaster
,
managed
to
get

out
of
the
wreckage
that
was
once
a
home
an

tried
to
find
her
husband
.

He
was
found

crushed
and
died

It
was
necessary
to
saw
away
several
[

before
Mr.
Chapman
could
be
gotten
out
.

Jacob
Kronder
,

and
employee
of
William

Merrell
at
Pitcher
Hill
,
is
likely
to

die
.

He
and
Merrell
were
in
the
barn
when

the
cyclone
came
.

A
beam
struck
Kronder

and
he
went
down
.

The
wind
seemed
to
pick

up
the
barn
and
carry
it
and
Mr.
Merrell
rode
in

the
storm
,
praying
to
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
as
he
was
carried

along
.

Wagons
were
driven
pas
him
by
the

wind
.

In
an
instant
it
was
over
,
but
it

seemed
like
years
.

Merrell
's
home
and

furniture
and
several
barns
were
destroyed
.

was
between
his
house
and
barn
when
the
cyclone

struck
him
and
he
was
knocked
down
by
flying

timbers
.

His
injuries
while
not
apparently

serious
may
develop
seriously
.

William
Michaels
's

house
,
just
south
of
the

Chapman
's
place
,
is
twisted
out
of

shape
and
his
barn
is
completely
demolished
.

In
the
wreckage
of
the
barn
lies
a
white
horse
,

killed
by
the
falling
timbers
.

The
house

outside
does
not
look
so
bad
but
inside
it
is
a

wreck
.

It
is
twisted
out
of
shape
,

plastering
is
fallen
everywhere
.

Mr.

Michaels
was
going
from
the
barn
to
the
house

and
the
wind
blew
him
against
the
house
with

great
force
...

The
homes
of
Earl

Benz
and

Albert
Jewell
are
in
ruins
.

Fred
Zwicki

lost
part
of
his
house
and
all
of
his
barn
.

A
big
wagon
was
hurled
through
his
henhouse
.

Willard
Davis

lost
the
roof
from
his
house
and
not
a
shred
was

left
together
of
his
barn
.

In
his

[
illegible
]
are
dead
chickens
by
the
score
.

His
family
of
children
were
in
the
house
but

were
not
hurt
.

Mr.
Davis
was
in
a
lot
near

his
home
and
was
knocked
down
by
the
wind
,
while

flying
timbers
were
carried
over
his
head
.

He
was
not
injured
.

The
home
of
Sidney

Price
and
his
barn
were
wrecked
.

One
cow
as
left
in
the
cellar
of
the
barn
this

morning
and
neighbors
and
friends
tried
to
get

it
out
.

Another
cow
was
hurt
and

spectators
begged
that
it
be
killed
.

It
is
said

that
it
would
be
.

The
front
of
Mr.
Price
's

house
was
torn
off
and
only
two
rooms
were

undamaged
.

From
the
front
upstairs
a

little
picture
could
be
seen
this
morning

evidently
hurled
from
the
wall
and
fastened
by

the
wind
across
the
end
of
a
partition
that
it

had
torn
off
.

This

double
tragedy

2
days
after

birth
of

first
child

also
named
Alice
,

affected
TR	B	TR	Theodore_Roosevelt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt	000	000
greatly

“
Issues
of
moral
integrity
and
traditional
conceptions
of
order
have
been
nuetralized
by
slick
marketing
campaigns
and
a
Western
derived
social
propaganda
of
moral
,
political
and
economic
liberalism
.

The
vaunted
American
century
is
the
capstone
of
the
white/Western
world
’s
five
century
expansion
which
has
been
driven
by
a
monstrous
and
insatiable
appetite
for
carnage
and
destruction
,
as
it
progressed
toward
world
domination
and
‘
supremacy
’
.

The
genocidal
campaigns
and
colonial
settlement
of
the
Americas
and
Australia
and
the
libidinous
genetic
infusion
into
the
gene
pools
of
every
racial
type
that
succumbed
to
its
campaigns
of
terror
and
destruction
evidence
the
insane
barbarism
of
the
“
Western
man
”
and
his
‘
civilization
”
.

These
historic
conditions
partially
frame
the
condition
of
the
Afrikan
world
at
the
close
of
the
20th
century
.

Don	B	Don Imus	Don_Imus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Imus	000	000
Imus	I	Don Imus	Don_Imus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Imus	000	000
issue
is
gradually
making
its
way
to
the
back
burner
of
media
exposure
and
thus
our
consciousness
,
the
ruling
elites
having
decided
that
’s
enough
of
that
.

Now
we
are
being
bombarded
by
the
media
giving
us
minute
by
minuet
coverage
of
the
carnage
and
slaying
on
the
campus
of
Virginia	B	Virginia Tech	Virginia_Tech	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech	000	000
Tech	I	Virginia Tech	Virginia_Tech	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech	000	000
.

In
the
backdrop
the
ongoing
war
and
occupation
of
Iraq	B	Iraq	Iraq	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq	000	000
and
the
incessant
Sabre
rattling
directed
at
Iran	B	Iran	Iran	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran	000	000
is
just
enough
to
keep
us
on
edge
as
the
beat
goes
on
.

Meanwhile
,
black
folks
continue
to
degrade
,
debase
and
kill
each
other
at
an
ever
increasingly
alarming
rate
.

I
was
watching
the
Oprah
Winfrey
television
show
yesterday
,
her
“
Town
Meeting
”
focusing
on
the
Don
Imus
brouhaha
when
the
local
ABC
affiliate
interrupted
her
program
to
provide
more
information
on
the
situation
at
Virginia
Tech
.

Prior
to
the
interruption
psychologist
Dr.
Robin
Smith
was
explaining
to
Oprah
and
her
audience
the
Don
Imus
incident
was
not

really
about
Don	B	Don Imus	Don_Imus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Imus	000	000
Imus	I	Don Imus	Don_Imus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Imus	000	000
,
it
was
actually
deeply
indicative
of
the
spiritual
void
at
the
core
of
AmeriKKKa	B	AmeriKKKa	AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	000	000
.

She
explained
it
was
not
just
the
Rutgers	B	Rutgers	Rutgers_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutgers_University	000	000
student
athletes
who
were
being
demeaned
,
it
was
all
of
AmeriKKKa	B	AmeriKKKa	AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	000	000
.

She
said
succinctly
that
anytime
a
person
denigrates
another
they
also
tear
themselves
.

Dr.
Smith
is
on
the
case
on
this
one
.

When
we
look
at
AmeriKKKa	B	AmeriKKKa	AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	000	000
we
see
a
nation
with
a
long
and
continuous
history
of
wanton
violence
,
bloodletting
,
genocide
and
rapine
.

The
Europeans	B	Europeans	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
who
invaded
and
settled
this
hemisphere
brought
their
culture
of
war
,
pillage
,
plunder
social
and
ecological
disruption
with
them
.

In
fact
they
have
carried
that
tradition
everywhere
they
have
set
foot
on
planet
earth
!

Given
this
is
their
historical
legacy
,
why
are
we
shocked
at
a
Don	B	Don Imus	Don_Imus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Imus	000	000
Imus	I	Don Imus	Don_Imus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Imus	000	000
who
spews
insults
and
epithets
at
black
people
in
an
effort
to
“
entertain
”
his
mostly
white
male
listeners
.

Words
are
an
outgrowth
of
thoughts
as
are
actions
.

Take
a
look
around
and
ask
yourself
what
are
the
real
values
AmeriKKKa
disseminates
to
the
world
?

Now
white
pretend
to
be
shocked
at
what
happened
at
Virginia	B	Virginia Tech	Virginia_Tech	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech	000	000
Tech	I	Virginia Tech	Virginia_Tech	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech	000	000
just
like
they
did
at
Columbine	B	Columbine High School	Columbine_High_School	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School	000	000
High	I	Columbine High School	Columbine_High_School	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School	000	000
School	I	Columbine High School	Columbine_High_School	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School	000	000
years
ago
.

Nonsense
!

These
are
the
real
notions
white
AmeriKKKa	B	AmeriKKKa	AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	000	000
holds
dear
.

The
killers
are
merely
expressing
the
real
motives
,
values
and
psychology
of
AmeriKKKa	B	AmeriKKKa	AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	000	000
.

Dr.
Amos
Wilson
once
noted
white
people
’s
true
psychology
and
values
are
n’t
found
in
their
psychology
books
or
their
religious
dogma
,
their
real
values
are
found
in
their
history
.

As
tragic
as
the
murders
were
at
Virginia	B	Virginia Tech	Virginia_Tech	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech	000	000
Tech	I	Virginia Tech	Virginia_Tech	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech	000	000
a
brother
reminded
us
via
E-mail
that
the
biggest
murder
spree
in
AmeriKKKa	B	AmeriKKKa	AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	000	000
took
place
in
Tulsa	B	Tulsa Oklahoma	Tulsa,_Oklahoma	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma	000	000
Oklahoma	I	Tulsa Oklahoma	Tulsa,_Oklahoma	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma	000	000
in
1921
when
rampaging
whites
went
berserk
and
burned
thirty-five
blocks
in
the
black
neighborhood
of
Greenwood	B	Greenwood	Greenwood,_Tulsa,_Oklahoma	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood,_Tulsa,_Oklahoma	000	000
in
North
Tulsa
.

Even
the
National	B	National Guard	National_Guard_of_the_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_of_the_United_States	000	000
Guard	I	National Guard	National_Guard_of_the_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_of_the_United_States	000	000
who
were
called
in
to
restore
order
turned
on
the
blacks
who
had
armed
to
defended
themselves
against
the
marauding
mob
,
opening
fire
on
the
blacks
who
were
huddled
together
to
defend
themselves
against
vicious
attack
.

What
do
you
expect
in
the
most
violent
country
on
the
face
of
the
earth
?

This
is
just
one
example
of
the
state
using
its
considerable
powers
to
turn
on
the
indigenous
inhabitants
of
this
land
as
well
as
the
Africans	B	Africans	Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa	000	000
they
imported
here
!

What
the
National	B	National Guard	National_Guard_of_the_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_of_the_United_States	000	000
Guard	I	National Guard	National_Guard_of_the_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_of_the_United_States	000	000
no
longer
does
to
black
folks
in
AmeriKKKa	B	AmeriKKKa	AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmeriKKKa's_Most_Wanted	000	000
it
now
does
to
Iraqis	B	Iraqis	Iraq	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq	000	000
in
Iraq	B	Iraq	Iraq	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq	000	000
under

.

The
hatred
white
folks
used
to
spew
on
blacks
in
1921
with
impunity
Don	B	Don Imus	Don_Imus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Imus	000	000
Imus	I	Don Imus	Don_Imus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Imus	000	000
now
does
on
the
radio
in
2007
.

Only
this
time
his
corporate
master
’s
kicked
him
off
the
train
to
save
their
hides
when
the
pressure
got
a
little
to
high
for
them
.

It
is
business
as
usual
for
the
barbarians
.

The
most
tragic
aspect
of
all
this
is
we
have
internalized
the
barbarians
’
fear
and
loathing
of
Africans	B	Africans	Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa	000	000
.

Our
children
now
degrade
and
act
out
every
vile
and
negative
stereotype
created
in
the
demented
psyches
of
European	B	European	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
males
.

This
is
not
by
accident
.

The
Europeans	B	Europeans	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
discovered
long
ago
the
best
way
to
dummy
us
down
,
stupify
and
neutralize
us
was
to
use
our
own
music
as
a
weapon
on
us
!

Just
when
our
young
people
were
using
the
new
genre
of
Hip-Hop	B	Hip-Hop	Hip_hop	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop	000	000
to
carry
on
the
liberation
struggle
,
the
white
corporate
oligarchy
altered
the
music
scene
and
provided
a
counter
to
conscious
rappers
like
Public	B	Public Enemy	Public_Enemy_(group)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Enemy_(group)	000	000
Enemy	I	Public Enemy	Public_Enemy_(group)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Enemy_(group)	000	000
and
KRS-One	B	KRS-One	KRS-One	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRS-One	000	000
.

They
began
to
promote
degenerates
like
2
Live
Crew
and
NWA	B	NWA	N.W.A	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.W.A	000	000
.

Before
long
a
new
substrata
of
Hip-Hop	B	Hip-Hop	Hip_hop	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop	000	000
a
rough
,
gritty
and
sociopathic
style
called
Gangsta	B	Gangsta Rap	Gangsta_rap	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangsta_rap	000	000
Rap	I	Gangsta Rap	Gangsta_rap	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangsta_rap	000	000
took
root
in
the
hood
,
it
was
aggressively
promoted
on
the
white
owned
cable
,
FM	B	FM	FM_broadcasting	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM_broadcasting	000	000
stations
and
later
in
films
and
videos
.

When
wise
elders
like
C.	B	C. Delores Tucker	C._Delores_Tucker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Delores_Tucker	000	000
Delores	I	C. Delores Tucker	C._Delores_Tucker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Delores_Tucker	000	000
Tucker	I	C. Delores Tucker	C._Delores_Tucker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._Delores_Tucker	000	000
and
Rev.
Calvin	B	Calvin Butts	Calvin_O._Butts	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_O._Butts	000	000
Butts	I	Calvin Butts	Calvin_O._Butts	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_O._Butts	000	000
stepped
up
to
warn
us
about
the
potentially
negative
and
damaging
impact
of
Gangsta	B	Gangsta Rap	Gangsta_rap	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangsta_rap	000	000
Rap	I	Gangsta Rap	Gangsta_rap	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangsta_rap	000	000
in
the
‘
90
's
they
were
viciously
attacked
mocked
and
derided
by
apolitical
retrograde
corporate
mercenaries
.

Two
years
ago
when
Bill	B	Bill Cosby	Bill_Cosby	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby	000	000
Cosby	I	Bill Cosby	Bill_Cosby	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cosby	000	000
stood
up
to
challenge
the
insanity
he
too
was
vilified
by
the
corporate
stooges
and
lackeys
.

These
uncultured
synchophats
denounced
their
detractors
under
the
guise
of
cultural
authenticity
,
saying
they
were
“
keeping
it
real
”
.

Their
lack
of
historical
insight
was
matched
only
by
their
arrogance
.

These
semi
literate
buffoons
actually
think
their
retrograde
brand
of
creativity
is
the
first
form
of
black
music
to
be
authentic
and
true
to
the
black
experience
!

Since
most
of
them
are
not
real
musicians
they
know
nothing
about
the
Blues	B	Blues	Blues	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues	000	000
,
or
the
circumstances
,
situations
and
artists
that
created
them
.

Or
anything
else
that
flowed
from
the
black
experience
.

But
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
,
we
must
assume
responsibility
for
their
ignorance
.

We
failed
to
teach
them
our
history
.

We
failed
to
connect
them
with
the
struggles
of
men
on
the
chain
gangs
,
on
the
plantations
who
created
the
work
songs
and
shouts
.

We
neglected
to
tell
them
about
the
struggles
Charlie	B	Charlie Parker	Charlie_Parker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker	000	000
Parker	I	Charlie Parker	Charlie_Parker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker	000	000
,
Billie	B	Billie Holiday	Billie_Holiday	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday	000	000
Holiday	I	Billie Holiday	Billie_Holiday	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Holiday	000	000
,
Sam	B	Sam Cook	Sam_Cooke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cooke	000	000
Cook	I	Sam Cook	Sam_Cooke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Cooke	000	000
or
Veejay	B	Veejay Records	Vee-Jay_Records	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vee-Jay_Records	000	000
Records	I	Veejay Records	Vee-Jay_Records	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vee-Jay_Records	000	000
waged
for
artistic
freedom
and
a
real
pay
day
.

Now
these
chickens
have
come
home
to
roost
in
our
homes
and
communities
.

Don	B	Don Imus	Don_Imus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Imus	000	000
Imus	I	Don Imus	Don_Imus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Imus	000	000
got
fired
over
his
latest
racist
remarks
even
though
our
reaction
was
misguided
.

If
Imus	B	Imus	Don_Imus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Imus	000	000
got
fired
,
how
is
it
a
whole
pack
of
decadent
“
black
”
slime
merchants
gets
a
free
pass
to
degrade
and
perpetual
the
vilest
stereotypes
against
their
own
people
?

How
do
sane
people
allow
this
to
happen
?

How
does
the
ruling
oligarchy
dupe
the
masses
of
AmeriKKKans
into
allowing
them
to
kill
,
maim
and
steal
the
natural
resources
of
Iraq
,
Haiti
,
Afghanistan
or
whatever
country
you
want
in
the
blank
.

How
is
it
there
is
no
outcry
over
the
more
than
600,000
Iraqis
the
US
has
slaughtered
during
the
past
four
years
?

These
things
happen
for
the
same
reasons
there
was
no
outcry
against
the
slaughter
of
the
Native
Americans
or
African
people
.

The
so
called
good
white
folks
lack
the
will
to
change
things
.

We
as
African
people
are
too
impotent
to
stop
the
escalating
fratricide
in
our
communities
,
the
prostitution
of
our
creativity
and
the
use
of
our
genius
to
subjugate
,
castrate
and
dehumanize
ourselves
.

That
is
the
bottom
line
!

We
seem
to
have
lost
the

will
to
resist
,
redeem
ourselves
or
fight
for
our
survival
.

One
Afrocentric	B	Afrocentric	Afrocentrism	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrocentrism	000	000
psychologist
says
we
suffer
from
“
survival
fatigue
”
we
’re
too
beat
down
to
resist
and
fight
for
our
survival
.

I
suspect
we
suffer
more
from
what
I
call
the
sell
out
syndrome
than
anything
else
.

Our
kids
do
n’t
know
who
we/they
are
,
.

They
do
n’t
know
the
resilient
and
strong
people
they
come
from
,
all
they
know
is
they
do
n’t
want
to
be

Will
there
be
animals
in
heaven
?

By
Randy
Alcorn

Elijah	B	Elijah	Elijah_(oratorio)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_(oratorio)	000	000
was
taken
up
to
heaven
in
a
chariot
pulled
by
horses
(
2	B	2 Kings	Books_of_Kings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_of_Kings	000	000
Kings	I	2 Kings	Books_of_Kings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_of_Kings	000	000
2:11
)
.

We
’re
told
there
are
horses
in
heaven	B	heaven	Heaven_(Christianity)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_(Christianity)	000	000
(
Revelation	B	Revelation	Book_of_Revelation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation	000	000
6:2
-8
;
19:11
)
.

In
fact
,
there
are
lots
of
horses
,
enough
for
the
vast
armies
of
heaven
to
ride
(
Revelation	B	Revelation	Book_of_Revelation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation	000	000
19:11
;
2
Kings	B	Kings	Books_of_Kings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_of_Kings	000	000
6:17
)
.

Other
animals
are
n’t
mentioned
in
the
Revelation	B	Revelation	Book_of_Revelation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Revelation	000	000
passages
,
presumably
because
they
do
n’t
play
a
role
in
Christ	B	Christ	Christ	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ	000	000
’s
second
coming
(
an
army
bringing
deliverance
rides
horses
,
not
Dalmatians
or
hedgehogs
)
.

But
is
n’t
it
likely
that
since
there
are
innumerable
horses
in
heaven
there
are
all
kinds
of
other
animals
too
?

Why
would
n’t
there
be
?

Why
would
we
expect
horses
to
be
the
only
animals
?

If
there
were
no
other
animals
,
there
would
n’t
be
horses
.

In
Isaiah	B	Isaiah	Isaiah	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah	000	000
65:17
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
refers
to
creating
a
New
Heavens
and
a
New	B	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
Earth	I	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
.

In
subsequent
verses
the
text
seems
to
move
back
and
forth
from
the
millennial
kingdom
to
the
New	B	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
Earth	I	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
.

God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
makes
clear
he
will
have
animals
living
there
--
either
in
the
millennium
or
the
New	B	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
Earth	I	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
or
both
(
Isaiah	B	Isaiah	Isaiah	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah	000	000
65:25
)
.

Some
also
argue
for
animals
being
in
heaven
based
on
Ecclesiastes	B	Ecclesiastes	Ecclesiastes	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes	000	000
3:19
-21
,
which
says
“
Man	B	Man	Man	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man	000	000
’s
fate
is
like
that
of
the
animals
...
all
go
to
the
same
place
.
”

However
,
in
the
larger
context
of
Ecclesiastes
Solomon
is
simply
talking
about
the
outward
appearance
of
death
.

Men
and
animals
both
die
and
we
ca
n’t
see
where
they
go
.

Scripture	B	Scripture	Religious_text	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_text	000	000
tells
us
elsewhere
,
however
,
that
man
has
an
eternal
soul
.

It
tells
us
he
goes
one
of
two
places
at
death
.

Animals
are
not
said
to
have
eternal
souls
.

They
are
not
said
to
relocate
when
they
die
.

The
presumption
would
be
that
at
death
they
cease
to
exist
.

However
,
this
does
n’t
mean
beloved
animals
wo
n’t
be
in
heaven
.

I
once
read
Billy	B	Billy Graham	Billy_Graham	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Graham	000	000
Graham	I	Billy Graham	Billy_Graham	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Graham	000	000
’s
response
to
a
little
girl
’s
question
,
“
Will
my
dog
who
died
this
week
be
in
heaven
?
”

Graham	B	Graham	Billy_Graham	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Graham	000	000
replied
,
“
If
it
would
make
you
any
happier
,
then
yes
,
he
will
be
.
”

Animals
are
n’t
nearly
as
valuable
as
people
,
but
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
is
their
maker
and
has
touched
many
people
’s
lives
through
them
.

It
would
be
simple
for
Him
to
recreate
a
pet
in
heaven
.

I
see
no
reason
to
believe
he
would
n’t
if
it
would
bring
his
children
pleasure
.

Romans	B	Romans	Ancient_Rome	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome	000	000
8:18
-22
says
that
the
whole
creation
was
subject
to
suffering
and
futility
because
of
human
sin
.

The
creation
groans
in
longing
for
the
liberation
that
will
come
to
humans
,
and
thereby
to
all
creation
itself
.

Creation
is
under
man
’s
dominion
and
will
share
the
rewards
of
his
redemption
just
as
it
shared
the
punishment
for
his
sin
.

Animals
are
a
central
part
of
that
creation
,
next
to
man
himself
the
most
significant
part
.

After
all
,
besides
his
wife
,
Adam	B	Adam	Last_Adam	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Adam	000	000
was
called
upon
to
give
names
only
to
one
other
part
of
the
creation
--
the
animals
(
Genesis	B	Genesis	Book_of_Genesis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis	000	000
2:19
-20
)
.

He
worked
the
garden
,
but
he
was
n’t
invited
to
name
the
vegetation
.

Clearly
,
the
animals
had
certain
qualities
that
set
them
above
other
creation
.

They
were
to
be
special
to
man
,
and
his
naming
them
makes
his
connection
with
them
personal
.

If
the
New	B	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
Earth	I	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
is
all
the
best
of
the
old
earth
and
more
,
then
we
should
expect
it
to
contain
animals
.

If
animals
were
n’t
part
of
the
New	B	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
Earth	I	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
,
this
would
seem
an
obvious
oversight
.

Eden	B	Eden	Garden_of_Eden	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden	000	000
was
ruined
through
sin
and
will
be
restored
through
Christ	B	Christ	Christ	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ	000	000
’s
reign
of
righteousness
.

All
that
was
part
of
Eden	B	Eden	Garden_of_Eden	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden	000	000
,
and
then
made
wrong
through
the
sin
of
the
first
Adam	B	Adam	Last_Adam	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Adam	000	000
,
we
would
expect
to
be
part
of
the
New	B	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
Earth	I	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
,
made
right
through
the
virtue
of
the
Second	B	Second Adam	Last_Adam	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Adam	000	000
Adam	I	Second Adam	Last_Adam	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Adam	000	000
.

Would
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
take
away
from
us
in
heaven
what
he
gave
,
for
delight
and
companionship
and
help
,
to
Adam	B	Adam and Eve	Adam_and_Eve	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve	000	000
and	I	Adam and Eve	Adam_and_Eve	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve	000	000
Eve	I	Adam and Eve	Adam_and_Eve	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve	000	000
in
Eden	B	Eden	Garden_of_Eden	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden	000	000
?

Would
he
revoke
his
earlier
decision
to
put
animals
with
man
,
and
under
man
’s
care
?

If
he
remakes
the
New	B	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
Earth	I	New Earth	The_New_Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Earth	000	000
with
new
men
(
who
look
very
much
like
the
old
men
,
only
perfect
)
,
would
n’t
we
expect
him
also
to
make
new
animals
(
who
will
presumably
look
like
the
old
animals
,
only
perfect
)
?

NATHAN	B	NATHAN BROWN	Nathan_Brown_(rugby_league)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Brown_(rugby_league)	000	000
BROWN	I	NATHAN BROWN	Nathan_Brown_(rugby_league)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Brown_(rugby_league)	000	000
said
straight
after
the
pre-season
defeat
at
Castleford	B	Castleford	Castleford_Tigers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castleford_Tigers	000	000
a
week
ago
that
his
side
needed
to
put
in
a
lot
of
hard
work
before
next
month
’s
start
of
the
Super	B	Super League XVII	Super_League_XVII	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_League_XVII	000	000
League	I	Super League XVII	Super_League_XVII	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_League_XVII	000	000
XVII	I	Super League XVII	Super_League_XVII	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_League_XVII	000	000
season
.

But
judging
by
last
night
’s
effort
against
a
youthful
Wigan	B	Wigan	Wigan_Warriors	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigan_Warriors	000	000
at
the
DW
Stadium
for
Warriors	B	Warriors	Golden_State_Warriors	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors	000	000
captain
Sean
O’Loughlin
’s
testimonial
game
,
there
’s
probably
even
more
work
required
than
anyone
realised
!

Yes
,
the
Giants	B	Giants	Huddersfield_Giants	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddersfield_Giants	000	000
may
have
won
the
game
30-18
,
but
that
merely
papered
over
some
very
obvious
cracks
.

For
large
parts
of
this
trial
contest
the
Giants	B	Giants	Huddersfield_Giants	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddersfield_Giants	000	000
looked
disjointed
on
attack
and
unsure
on
defence
,
which
must
have
been
a
real
worry
for
Brown	B	Brown	Brown	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown	000	000
and
his
coaching
staff
,
particularly
with
the
League	B	League	Sports_league	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_league	000	000
opener
at
Wigan	B	Wigan	Wigan_Warriors	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigan_Warriors	000	000
just
around
the
corner
on
Sunday
,
February
5
.

And
that
was
despite
the
Galpharm	B	Galpharm	Galpharm_International	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galpharm_International	000	000
chief
making
limited
changes
to
the
side
that
took
to
the
field
for
the
32-22
defeat
at
the
Tigers	B	Tigers	Castleford_Tigers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castleford_Tigers	000	000
.

The
only
switch
in
the
backs
was
at
centre
,
with
Lee	B	Lee Gilmour	Lee_Gilmour	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Gilmour	000	000
Gilmour	I	Lee Gilmour	Lee_Gilmour	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Gilmour	000	000
taking
over
from
Joe	B	Joe Wardle	Joe_Wardle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Wardle	000	000
Wardle	I	Joe Wardle	Joe_Wardle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Wardle	000	000
,
who
picked
up
a
hip
injury
in
last
week
’s
clash
.

In
the
pack
,
Dale	B	Dale Ferguson	Dale_Ferguson_(rugby_league)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Ferguson_(rugby_league)	000	000
Ferguson	I	Dale Ferguson	Dale_Ferguson_(rugby_league)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Ferguson_(rugby_league)	000	000
marked
his
first
game
of
the
year
following
shoulder
surgery
by
moving
up
from
second
row
to
prop
.

Another
key
switch
was
new
signing
Tommy	B	Tommy Lee	Tommy_Lee_(rugby_league)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Lee_(rugby_league)	000	000
Lee	I	Tommy Lee	Tommy_Lee_(rugby_league)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Lee_(rugby_league)	000	000
shifting
from
hooker
to
loose-forward
.

Yet
while
the
Giants	B	Giants	Huddersfield_Giants	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddersfield_Giants	000	000
fielded
their
strongest
available
squad
,
the
Warriors	B	Warriors	Wigan_Warriors	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigan_Warriors	000	000
sent
a
largely
inexperienced
line-up
into
battle
,
with
just
a
handful
of
players
with
an
impressive
Super
League
CV
.

Unfortunately
,
that
hardly
showed
in
the
opening
exchanges
as
--
just
like
at
Castleford	B	Castleford	Castleford_Tigers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castleford_Tigers	000	000
--
Huddersfield	B	Huddersfield	Huddersfield_Giants	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huddersfield_Giants	000	000
made
a
shaky
start
.

On
Wigan	B	Wigan	Wigan_Warriors	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigan_Warriors	000	000
’s
first
attack
after
three
minutes
they
took
the
lead
through
their
new
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
centre
Anthony	B	Anthony Gelling	Anthony_Gelling	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gelling	000	000
Gelling	I	Anthony Gelling	Anthony_Gelling	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gelling	000	000
,
and
the
scene
had
been
set
for
a
far
from
encouraging
opening
40
minutes
.

Although
the
visitors
nudged
6-4
ahead
after
12
minutes
when
Danny	B	Danny Brough	Danny_Brough	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Brough	000	000
Brough	I	Danny Brough	Danny_Brough	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Brough	000	000
followed
up
his
own
bomb
and
then
added
the
conversion
,
they
continued
to
look
unconvincing
.

With
errors
aplenty
,
the
youthful
Warriors
were
only
too
pleased
to
take
full
advantage
,
crossing
for
further
tries
through
Gareth	B	Gareth Hock	Gareth_Hock	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Hock	000	000
Hock	I	Gareth Hock	Gareth_Hock	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Hock	000	000
and
John
O’Donnell
to
make
it
12-6
after
28
minutes
.

Thank
goodness
Jack
Murphy
was
off
target
with
his
three
touchline
conversion
attempts
!

tournament	I	NCAA tournament	NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	000	000
hopes
of
a
team
once
flirting
with
the
top
10
--
or
a
second-straight
setback
minus
key
players
.

“
The
main
thing
right
now
for
our
guys
to
understand
is
the
importance
of
making
good
decisions
and
understanding
the
consequences
when
you
make
poor
decisions
and
then
moving
on
from
that
and
learning
from
that
,
”
Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
said
.

“
So
we
’re
dealing
with
that
.

It
’s
disappointing
and
unfortunate
that
we
have
to
deal
with
this
in
the
middle
of
the
season
.

“
It
is
what
it
is
,
so
right
now
as
a
team
we
have
to
focus
on
the
things
we
can
control
,
and
we
have
a
very
challenging
game
here
against
a
very
talented
opponent
in
Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
.

We
have
to
get
ready
to
play
the
game
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000

,
Releford	B	Releford	Trevor_Releford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Releford	000	000
and
Steele
indefinitely
just
before
Saturday
’s
loss
at
LSU	B	LSU	LSU_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football	000	000
for
violating
team
rules
,
sending
them
packing
for
Tuscaloosa	B	Tuscaloosa	Tuscaloosa,_Alabama	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama	000	000
before
tipoff.That
was
also
the
second
game
of
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
’s
suspension.The
disciplinary
actions
left
the
Tide
(
16-8
,
5-5
Southeastern	B	Southeastern Conference	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
Conference	I	Southeastern Conference	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
)
without
players
responsible
for
69
percent
of
its
scoring
,
57
percent
of
rebounding
and
54
percent
of
assists
at
a
time
when
the
stakes
are
ratcheted
up
.

Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
and
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
are
the
team
’s
top
scorers
and
rebounders
,
while
Releford	B	Releford	Trevor_Releford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Releford	000	000
leads
Alabama
in
assists
and
Steele
is
a
key
role
player
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
said
his
decision
to
hold
the
players
out
had
much
to
do
with
the
long-term
quality
of
the
program
and
trying
to
build
“
the
values
and
standards
that
you
want
your
team
to
represent
.
”

He
has
n’t
elaborated
on
the
reasons
for
the
suspensions
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
declined
to
say
if
the
violations
of
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
and
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
were
more
serious
,
but
reiterated
that
their
suspension
remained
indefinite
.

“
I
do
n’t
want
to
get
into
that
,
that
’s
just
the
way
it
is
right
now
,
”
he
said.This
is
the
third
time
Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
has
suspended
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
,
a
first-team
All
-
SEC	B	SEC	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
player
,
during
his
three
seasons
,
including
a
three-game
string
early
last
season
and
one
game
at
the
end
of
2009-10
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
did
n’t
rule
it
out
when
asked
if
he
had
a
“
three-strike
”
policy
that
might
keep
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
from
returning
.

“
I
’ll
make
some
decisions
on
that
later
,
”
he
said
.

“
Right
now
my
focus
is
on
getting
prepared
for
Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
.
”

Alabama
had
risen
to
No.
12
in
the
rankings
in
December
and
won
three
straight
before
the
LSU	B	LSU	LSU_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football	000	000
game.The
bold
decision
on
the
suspensions
was
no
surprise
to
Gators
coach
Billy	B	Billy Donovan	Billy_Donovan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan	000	000
Donovan	I	Billy Donovan	Billy_Donovan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan	000	000
,
who
was
Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
’s
boss
for
a
dozen
years
at
Marshall	B	Marshall	Marshall_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_University	000	000
and
Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
.

“
I
know
Anthony	B	Anthony Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
Grant	I	Anthony Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
about
as
well
as
anybody
,
and
I
think
that
he
has
got
incredible
integrity
and
character
and
knows
exactly
the
way
he
wants
his
program
run
and
what
he
’s
going
to
do
,
”
Donovan	B	Donovan	Billy_Donovan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan	000	000
said.The
Tide
’s
eight
remaining
players
--
half
of
them
freshmen
--
managed
to
come
fairly
close
before
losing
67-58
to
LSU	B	LSU	LSU_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football	000	000
,
with
freshman
Rodney
Cooper
scoring
28
points
.

Alabama
had
beaten
Auburn	B	Auburn	Auburn_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_Tigers_football	000	000
by
18
points
without
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
.

Now
comes
a
much
bigger
challenge
,
even
with
Releford	B	Releford	Trevor_Releford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Releford	000	000
and
Steele.The
Gators
(
19-6
,
7-3
)
opened
last
March
with
a
78-51
rout
of
a
Tide
team
that
still
had
aspirations
of
winning
an
SEC	B	SEC	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
title
and
making
the
NCAA	B	NCAA	NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	000	000
field
.

Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
is
also
short-handed
,
but
because
of
injuries
.

The
Gators
wo
n’t
have
their
top
subs
,
forward
Will
Yeguete
(
concussion
)
and
guard
Mike
Rosario
(
bruised
hip
)
,
for
the
game

Alabama

reinforcements
for
Tuesday

game
against
No.

Grant	I	Anthony Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000

Releford	I	Trevor Releford	Trevor_Releford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Releford	000	000
and
Andrew
Steele
will
“
most
likely
”
return

a

that
could
supply
a
huge
boost

tournament	I	NCAA tournament	NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	000	000
hopes
of
a
team
once
flirting
with
the
top
10
--
or
a
second-straight
setback
minus
key
players
.

“
The
main
thing
right
now
for
our
guys
to
understand
is
the
importance
of
making
good
decisions
and
understanding
the
consequences
when
you
make
poor
decisions
and
then
moving
on
from
that
and
learning
from
that
,
”
Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
said
.

“
So
we
’re
dealing
with
that
.

It
’s
disappointing
and
unfortunate
that
we
have
to
deal
with
this
in
the
middle
of
the
season
.

“
It
is
what
it
is
,
so
right
now
as
a
team
we
have
to
focus
on
the
things
we
can
control
,
and
we
have
a
very
challenging
game
here
against
a
very
talented
opponent
in
Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
.

We
have
to
get
ready
to
play
the
game
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
suspended
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
,
Releford	B	Releford	Trevor_Releford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Releford	000	000
and
Steele
indefinitely
just
before
Saturday
’s
loss
at
LSU	B	LSU	LSU_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football	000	000
for
violating
team
rules
,
sending
them
packing
for
Tuscaloosa	B	Tuscaloosa	Tuscaloosa,_Alabama	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama	000	000
before
tipoff.That
was
also
the
second
game
of
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
’s
suspension.The
disciplinary
actions
left
the
Tide
(
16-8
,
5-5
Southeastern	B	Southeastern Conference	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
Conference	I	Southeastern Conference	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
)
without
players
responsible
for
69
percent
of
its
scoring
,
57
percent
of
rebounding
and
54
percent
of
assists
at
a
time
when
the
stakes
are
ratcheted
up
.

Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
and
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
are
the
team
’s
top
scorers
and
rebounders
,
while
Releford	B	Releford	Trevor_Releford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Releford	000	000
leads
Alabama
in
assists
and
Steele
is
a
key
role
player
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
said
his
decision
to
hold
the
players
out
had
much
to
do
with
the
long-term
quality
of
the
program
and
trying
to
build
“
the
values
and
standards
that
you
want
your
team
to
represent
.
”

He
has
n’t
elaborated
on
the
reasons
for
the
suspensions
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
declined
to
say
if
the
violations
of
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
and
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
were
more
serious
,
but
reiterated
that
their
suspension
remained
indefinite
.

“
I
do
n’t
want
to
get
into
that
,
that
’s
just
the
way
it
is
right
now
,
”
he
said.This
is
the
third
time
Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
has
suspended
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
,
a
first-team
All
-
SEC	B	SEC	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
player
,
during
his
three
seasons
,
including
a
three-game
string
early
last
season
and
one
game
at
the
end
of
2009-10
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
did
n’t
rule
it
out
when
asked
if
he
had
a
“
three-strike
”
policy
that
might
keep
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
from
returning
.

“
I
’ll
make
some
decisions
on
that
later
,
”
he
said
.

“
Right
now
my
focus
is
on
getting
prepared
for
Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
.
”

Alabama
had
risen
to
No.
12
in
the
rankings
in
December
and
won
three
straight
before
the
LSU	B	LSU	LSU_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football	000	000
game.The
bold
decision
on
the
suspensions
was
no
surprise
to
Gators
coach
Billy	B	Billy Donovan	Billy_Donovan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan	000	000
Donovan	I	Billy Donovan	Billy_Donovan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan	000	000
,
who
was
Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
’s
boss
for
a
dozen
years
at
Marshall	B	Marshall	Marshall_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_University	000	000
and
Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
.

“
I
know
Anthony	B	Anthony Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
Grant	I	Anthony Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
about
as
well
as
anybody
,
and
I
think
that
he
has
got
incredible
integrity
and
character
and
knows
exactly
the
way
he
wants
his
program
run
and
what
he
’s
going
to
do
,
”
Donovan	B	Donovan	Billy_Donovan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan	000	000
said.The
Tide
’s
eight
remaining
players
--
half
of
them
freshmen
--
managed
to
come
fairly
close
before
losing
67-58
to
LSU	B	LSU	LSU_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football	000	000
,
with
freshman
Rodney
Cooper
scoring
28
points
.

Alabama
had
beaten
Auburn	B	Auburn	Auburn_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_Tigers_football	000	000
by
18
points
without
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
.

Now
comes
a
much
bigger
challenge
,
even
with
Releford	B	Releford	Trevor_Releford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Releford	000	000
and
Steele.The
Gators
(
19-6
,
7-3
)
opened
last
March
with
a
78-51
rout
of
a
Tide
team
that
still
had
aspirations
of
winning
an
SEC	B	SEC	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
title
and
making
the
NCAA	B	NCAA	NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	000	000
field
.

Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
is
also
short-handed
,
but
because
of
injuries
.

The
Gators
wo
n’t
have
their
top
subs
,
forward
Will
Yeguete
(

and

confirmed

We
have
to
get
used

playing
here
when

full

need
to
punish

but
this

it

beautiful

could
be
regarded
as

chance

if
one

is

it

that

a

the

We

always
respect

countries
so
we
wo
n't
stop
him

going

Saying
that
,
it
's
not
very
clever
when
you
put
an
international
game
in
the
middle
of
a
week
when
you
have

I
think
they

from

ago
that

FA	I	Scottish FA	Scottish_Football_Association	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Football_Association	000	000
over
it

I
am
going
to
give
him
the
freedom
to
go
.

I
loved
playing
for
Uruguay	B	Uruguay	Uruguay	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay	000	000
.

I
will
never
stop
a
player
playing
for
their
national
team
.
"

I
am
very
pleased
for
Craig	B	Craig	Craig_Mackail-Smith	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Mackail-Smith	000	000
and
I
would
,
of
course
,
like
him
to
play
.

It
would
be
very
disappointing
if
he
goes
to
Scotland	B	Scotland	Scotland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland	000	000
,
misses
the
Gillingham	B	Gillingham	Gillingham_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillingham_F.C.	000	000

and
does
n't
play

so
it
's
up
to

In
a
perfect
world
,
those
same
individuals
would
be
on
the
field
16
weeks
later
as
well
.

However
,
we
all
know
injuries
are
as
much
a
part
of
football
as
the
football
itself
.

It
's
going
to
happen
.

Even
now
,
some
of
these
names
are
not
on
the
field
,
nor
will
they
be
until
2007
.

So
,
let
's
extrapolate
the
injury
issue
into
a
full
blown
Greek	B	Greek	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
tragedy
.

What
happens
if
we
lose
EVERY
starter
?

What
does
the
team
look
like
?

Join
me
in
this
walk
through
hell
,
will
you
?

Skill
Positions

QB
-
Ferrotte
-
Is
he
a
starter
?

Absolutely
not
.

However
,
Linehan
has
enough
faith
in
him
to
keep
him
in
his
pocket
in
Minny
and
Miami	B	Miami	Miami_Heat	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat	000	000
.

Can
he
handle
a
game
or
two
yea
,
but
an
extended
stay
in
the
pocket
could
get
ugly
.

RB
-
Committee
-
If
S.
Jack
goes
down
,
there
is
no
feature
back
left
on
the
roster
.

Davis
used
to
be
,
but
no
longer
.

Fisher
never
was
,
never
will
be
.

I
'm
not
fond
of
committees
,
but
used
properly
these
two
together
may
move
the
ball
better
than
expected

FB
-
Hedgecock
-
With
Smith
out
,
this
is
where
we
stand
now
.

The
kid
is
still
young
,
and
learning
his
2nd
NFL	B	NFL	National_Football_League	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League	000	000
offense
in
as
many
years
.

But
once
he
's
comfortable
,
this
kid
will
be
a
wrecking
ball
.

He
wo
n't
carry
the
ball
,
nor
do
we
want
him
to
.

He
does
one
thing
and
does
it
well
...
lead
block
.

Receivers

WR
-
Curtis
&
McDonald
-
It
's
just
not
fair
in
this
case
.

Both
these
guys
are
quality
wideouts
and
would
start
on
a
lot
of
other
teams
.

So
I
have
no
problem
with
them
as
starting
wideouts
.

The
problem
I
have
is
the
dropoff
from
Holt/Bruce
to
Curtis/McDonald
.

C
&
D
are
more
than
servicable
...
but
when
is
the
last
time
"
servicable
"
ever
passed
muster
when
referring
to
a
Rams	B	Rams	St._Louis_Rams	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Rams	000	000
wideout
?

TE
-
Walker
-
He
was
impressive
in
his
limited
time
.

I
do
n't
think
he
's
the
pass
catching
threat
of
Klop
,
but
I
love
his
blocking
skills
.

He
would
do
a
fine
job
,
assuming
Linehan
adapts
to
the
differences
between
Klop
and
Walker

O-Line

OT
-
Steussie/Strojny
-
Here
's
where
it
turns
ugly
.

Other
than
Pace	B	Pace	Pace_(speed)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pace_(speed)	000	000
and
Barron
,
there
's
only
one
other
OT
on
the
roster
,
Steussie
.

So
now
we
have
to
dip
into
the
practice
squad
with
Strojny
.

The
only
thing
that
keeps
me
from
sweating
bullets
on
this
one
is
because
in
this
scenario
Bulger	B	Bulger	Marc_Bulger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Bulger	000	000
is
already
hurt
.

They
ca
n't
hurt
him
twice
.

OG
-
Goldberg/Setterstom
-
This
spot
has
already
seen
plenty
of
flux
this
year
,
but
assuming
day
1
starters
(
RI	B	RI	Rhode_Island	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island	000	000
&
AT	B	AT	Austria	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria	000	000
)
are
out
,
I
do
n't
have
a
huge
problem
with
Goldberg
and
Setterstrom
.

Goldberg
is
proving
himself
now
,
and
I
think
Setterstrom
is
better
than
a
typical
7th
round
rookie
.

Would
n't
want
to
leave
with
them
forever
,
but
I
like
the
OG	B	OG	Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)	000	000
position
better
than
the
OT
position
in
this
one
.

OC
-
Incognito
-
Again
assuming
day
1
starter
(
McCollum	B	McCollum	Bill_McCollum	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_McCollum	000	000
)
...
oh
wait
,
no
need
to
assume
.

This
one
is
reality
and
will
be
the
rest
of
the
year
.

Personally
,
I
'm
all
for
it
.

I
think
RI	B	RI	Rhode_Island	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island	000	000
is
doing
a
great
job
adapting
to
the
spot
,
and
I
'd
like
to
see
him
stay
there
.

D-Line

DE
-
Adeyanju/Green
-
Vic	B	Vic	Victoria_(Australia)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)	000	000
is
already
getting
his
time
and
proving
to
be
solid
in
the
run
game
.

His
pass
rush
has
n't
shown
itself
yet
,
but
maybe
that
's
around
the
corner
.

Green	B	Green	Golf_course	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course	000	000
is
green
...
high
motor
,
all-effort
...
but
nothing
spectacular
.

DT
-
Fisk/Wroten
-
After
preseason
,
I
was
very
excited
to
see
what
Wroten
was
going
to
bring
.

Apparently
,
the
coaching
staff
has
yet
to
share
my
thoughts
.

For
now
,
Wroten
still
has
that
"
potential
"
albatross
around
his
neck
.

As
for
Fisk
,
solid
veteran
who
is
doing
a
decent
job
of
sucking
up
linemen
to
open
holes
for
blitzers
.

Linebackers

SLB
-
Smith
-
I
'm
not
going
to
lose
much
sleep
over
this
one
.

Chillar
has
not
been
everything
I
hoped
for
,
and
Smith
could
do
just
as
well
in
my
opinion
.

MLB	B	MLB	Major_League_Baseball	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball	000	000
-
Brooks
-
The
preseason
phenom
.

Can
he
translate
that
to
the
regular
season
?

I
'm
guessing
no
,
but
as
with
the
WR
spot
,
he
's
backing
up
today
's
icon
,
so
Brooks
wo
n't
get
a
fair
shake
if
he
has
to
take
over
.

WLB
-
Coakley
-
From
what
we
've
seen
so
far
,
DC
has
returned
to
a
younger
form
.

He
's
playing
both
the
run
and
especially
the
pass
pretty
well
,
when
he
's
in
.

If
he
had
to
take
over
for
Pisa
,
I
'd
certainly
miss
Pisa
,
but
DC
would
be
effective

Defensive
Backs

Corner
-
Hill/Butler
-
Hill
will
still
make
rookie
mistakes
,
but
his
time
to
start
is
right
around
the
corner
.

Butler
on
the
other
hand
must
not
be
right
,
either
physically
or
mentally
.

Can
Butler
come
back
to
form
?

If
so
,
I
do
n't
have
a
problem
with
him
and
Hill
at
the
corners

FS
-
Bartell
-
A
huge
question
mark
.

I
'm
pretty
certain
Bartell
will
not
be
as
comfortable
as
Atogwe
is
at
this
point
,
simply
from
lack
of
experience
,
but
Bartell
has
all
the
physical
and
mental
tools
to
be
a
decent
centerfielder
,
at
least
comparable
to
Atogwe
.

SS
-
Carter
-
I
ca
n't
get
excited
about
Carter
,
especially
following
Chavous
.

There
's
no
doubting
his
work
ethic
or
how
much
effort
he
displays
,
but
his
coverage
skills
make
him
look
more
and
more
like
a
small
LB	B	LB	Linebacker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker	000	000
rather
than
an
effective
SS	B	SS	Shortstop	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop	000	000
.

However
,
he
has
more
experience
than
most
on
this
list
,
so
who
's
to
say
?

So
,
would
this
team
make
it
happen
?

Probably
not
,
but
then
again
I
'm
not
convinced
the
1st
string
will
take
us
to
the
promised
land
either
.

I
'd
feel
okay
about
our
offense
with
the
exception
of
OT	B	OT	Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)	000	000
,
and
that
's
a
bad
spot
to
be
uncomfortable
about
when
talking
about
moving
the
ball
.

On
the
defense
,
the
pass
rush
would
be
non-existent
,
so
I
'm
afraid
opposing
QBs
would
pick
us
apart
like
fish
in
a
barrel
.

THIS
WAS
A
TEST
OF
THE
EMERGENCY
BROADCASTING
SYSTEM
.

HAD
THIS
BEEN
A
REAL
EMERGENCY
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
NOTIFIED
OF
WHICH
NEAREST
DOOR
TO
GO
SLAM
YOUR
HEAD
IN
WHILE
WAITING
FOR
THE
SEASON
TO
END
AND
STARTERS
TO
GET
HEALTHY
.

WE
NOW
RETURN
YOU
TO
YOUR
REGULARLLY
SCHEDULED
SEASON
.
"

Before
the
gates
of
excellence
the
high
gods
have
placed
sweat
;
long
is
the
road
thereto
and
rough
and
steep
at
first
;
but
when
the
heights
are
reached
,
then
there
is
ease
,
though
grievously
hard
in
the
winning
.

It

not

that
bad

we
actually
have
decent
depth
this
year
I

Even

that
the
surrender

lead
against

Rovers	I	Shamrock Rovers	Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.	000	000
was
“
the
most
difficult
result
to
take
this
season
”
,
after
his
side
played
the
league
leaders
off
the
Tallaght	B	Tallaght Stadium	Tallaght_Stadium	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallaght_Stadium	000	000
Stadium	I	Tallaght Stadium	Tallaght_Stadium	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallaght_Stadium	000	000
pitch
for
large
periods
,
before
a
cruel
late
twist
meant
they
had
to
be
content
with
just
a
point
.

The
lively
Mark
Griffin
belatedly
celebrated
his
20th
birthday
as
he
had
his
side
in
cruise
control
with
two
fine
finishes
,
only
for
ex-Lilywhite
Chris	B	Chris Turner	Chris_Turner_(footballer_born_1987)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Turner_(footballer_born_1987)	000	000
Turner	I	Chris Turner	Chris_Turner_(footballer_born_1987)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Turner_(footballer_born_1987)	000	000

11

Dennehy	I	Billy Dennehy	Billy_Dennehy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Dennehy	000	000

the
Hoops	B	Hoops	Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.	000	000
an
undeserved
2-2
draw
.

Heartbreaking

The
result
came
following
extremely
disappointing
defeats
,
for
very
different
reasons
,
by
Drogheda	B	Drogheda United	Drogheda_United_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drogheda_United_F.C.	000	000
United	I	Drogheda United	Drogheda_United_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drogheda_United_F.C.	000	000

.

But
Foster	B	Foster	Ian_Foster_(footballer)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Foster_(footballer)	000	000
felt
the
draw
in
Dublin	B	Dublin	Dublin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin	000	000
24
was
even
more
galling
.

“
It
’s
the
most
difficult
result
to
take
this
season
,
”
Ian	B	Ian	Ian_Foster_(footballer)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Foster_(footballer)	000	000
told
dundalkfc.com
.

“
I
do
n’t
think
we
deserved
to
drop
any
points
tonight
.

The
players
were
fabulous
.

It
was
a
wonderful
effort
from
all
of
them
.

It
’s
heartbreaking
to
concede
at
such
a
late
stage
.

You
would
expect
when
you
come
to
the
champions
that
they
might
get
the
ball
in
wide
areas
and
break
you
down
that
way
,
but
they
’ve
gone
route
one
and
stuck
balls
into
our
box
.

They
have
n’t
carved
us
open
or
worked
us
hard
.

They
never
looked
like
scoring
but
unfortunately
for
us
it
has
finished
2-2
and
that
’s
hard
to
take
.
”

Impetus

The
Lilywhites	B	Lilywhites	Preston_North_End_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_North_End_F.C.	000	000
were
comfortable
when
Griffin
doubled
his
and
his
side
’s
advantage
just
past
the
hour
mark
.

However
,
Rovers	B	Rovers	Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.	000	000
were
back
in
it
on
79
minutes
when
Peter	B	Peter Cherrie	Peter_Cherrie	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cherrie	000	000
Cherrie	I	Peter Cherrie	Peter_Cherrie	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cherrie	000	000
punched
only
as
far
as
ex-teammate
Turner	B	Turner	Chris_Turner_(footballer_born_1987)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Turner_(footballer_born_1987)	000	000
who
fired
to
an
empty
net
from
25-yards
.

And
Foster	B	Foster	Ian_Foster_(footballer)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Foster_(footballer)	000	000
was
particularly
disappointed
with
how
that
goal
was
conceded
.

“
I
do
n’t
think
my
‘
keeper
should
have
come
for
it
,
”
he
said
.

“
He
did
it
against
Drogheda	B	Drogheda	Drogheda_United_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drogheda_United_F.C.	000	000
and
did
n’t
get
there
.

Tonight
,
he
got
there
,
but
if
you
let
your
centre-half
deal
with
it
,
even
if
the
centre-half
does
n’t
win
the
header
,
their
player
is
n’t
going
to
score
.

So
,
yes
,
I
’m
hugely
disappointed
with
that
because
then
that
gives
them
the
impetus
to
go
and
throw
bodies
in
the
box
.

They
put
both
centre-halves
up
and
unfortunately
it
led
to
the
equaliser
.

Proud

“
I
thought
we
had
done
enough
,
”
he
added
,
as
the
equaliser
came
with
just
over
90
seconds
left
on
the
clock
.

“
We
defended
manfully
;
we
won
headers
,
we
won
second
balls
,
we
cleared
lines
.

Just
,
unfortunately
,
we
have
been
hit
with
a
sucker-punch
right
in
the
last
minute
.

But
we
have
been
fabulous
tonight
.

We
’re
all
disappointed
with
a
point
at
Shamrock	B	Shamrock Rovers	Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.	000	000
Rovers	I	Shamrock Rovers	Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock_Rovers_F.C.	000	000
.

The
level
of
performance
tonight
was
superb
.

We
should
have
been
2-0
up
before
we
first
scored
.

We
created
chance
after
chance
,
we
passed
them
to
death
and
we
made
them
look
like
the
away
team
.

I
could
n’t
be
prouder
of
the
players
--
we
were
excellent
tonight
.
”

Beforehand
,
most
Dundalk	B	Dundalk	Dundalk_F.C.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundalk_F.C.	000	000
fans
would
have
taken
a
point
.

But
asked
if
he
felt
it
was
two
thrown
away
,
Foster	B	Foster	Ian_Foster_(footballer)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Foster_(footballer)	000	000
said
:
“
I
’d
say
it
’s
two
dropped
--
I
would
n’t
say
we
threw
it
away
.

Griff
praise

“
The
game
is
not
over
until
it
’s
over
,
”
he
continued
.

“
But
I
do
n’t
think
they
deserved
anything
out
of
the
game
,
I
’ll
certainly
say
that
.

I
thought
my
players
were
fabulous
.

well

Ian	B	Ian	Ian_Foster_(footballer)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Foster_(footballer)	000	000
said
.

“
He
was
a
constant
threat
.

They
took
off
a
centre-half
because
he
could
n’t
deal
with
him
,
and
the
fella
they
brought
on
could
n’t
deal
with
him
either
.

I
’m
delighted
for
Mark
.

His
work
rate
and
his
energy
are
excellent
and
he
’s
a
constant
threat
in
and
around
the
box
.

He
took
his
goals
very
well
and
he
could
have
been
on
the
end
of
one
or
two
more
chances
as
well

and

Isaac	B	Isaac Asimov	Isaac_Asimov	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov	000	000
Asimov	I	Isaac Asimov	Isaac_Asimov	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov	000	000
was
one
of
the
great
explainers
of
the
age
.

Like
TH	B	TH Huxley	Thomas_Henry_Huxley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley	000	000
Huxley	I	TH Huxley	Thomas_Henry_Huxley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Henry_Huxley	000	000
,
he
was
motivated
by
profoundly
democratic
impulses
to
communicate
science
to
the
public
.

“
Science	B	Science	Science	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science	000	000
is
too
important
,
”
he
said
,
paraphrasing
Clemenceau
,
“
to
be
left
to
the
scientists
.
”

It
will
never
be
known
how
many
practicing
scientists
today
,
in
how
many
countries
,
owe
their
initial
inspiration
to
a
book
,
article
,
or
short
story
by
Isaac	B	Isaac Asimov	Isaac_Asimov	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov	000	000
Asimov	I	Isaac Asimov	Isaac_Asimov	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov	000	000
--
nor
how
many
ordinary
citizens
are
sympathetic
to
the
scientific
enterprise
from
the
same
cause
.

For
example
,
Marvin	B	Marvin Minsky	Marvin_Minsky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky	000	000
Minsky	I	Marvin Minsky	Marvin_Minsky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky	000	000
of
MIT	B	MIT	Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology	000	000
,
one
of
the
pioneers
of
artificial
intelligence
,
was
brought
to
his
subject
by
Asimov	B	Asimov	Isaac_Asimov	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov	000	000
's
robot
stories
(
initially
conceived
to
illustrate
human/robot
partnerships
and
to
counter
the
prevailing
notion
,
going
back
to
Frankenstein	B	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein	000	000
,
of
robots
as
necessarily
malign
)
.

At
a
time
when
science
fiction
was
mainly
devoted
to
action
and
adventure
,
Asimov	B	Asimov	Isaac_Asimov	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov	000	000
introduced
puzzle-solving
schemes
that
taught
science
and
thinking
along
the
way
.

A
number
of
his
phrases
and
ideas
have
insinuated
themselves
into
the
culture
of
science
--
for
example
,
his
spare
description
of
the
solar
system
as
“
four
planets
plus
debris
”
and
his
notion
of
one
day
carrying
icebergs
from
the
rings
of
Saturn	B	Saturn	Saturn	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn	000	000
to
the
arid
wastelands
of
Mars	B	Mars	Mars	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars	000	000
.

He
wrote
many
science
books
for
young
people
,
and
as
editor
of
his
own
science-fiction
magazine
he
made
efforts
to
encourage
young
writers
.

His
output
was
prodigious
,
approaching
500
volumes
,
always
in
his
characteristic
straightforward
,
plain-speaking
syntax
.

Part
of
the
reason
his

How
about
that
?

We
were
too
pessimistic
-
perhaps
we
were
too
concerned
about
Nady	B	Nady	Xavier_Nady	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Nady	000	000
's
power-free
showing
with
the
Bucs	B	Bucs	Pittsburgh_Pirates	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates	000	000
in
2006
-
but
ZiPS
pretty
much
nailed
it
.

Escroll
came
the
closest
,
guessing
that
Nady	B	Nady	Xavier_Nady	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Nady	000	000
would
hit
.285
/
.351
/
.476
if
we
was
n't
platooned
(
which
he
was
n't
)
.

Speaking
of
platooning
,
much
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
Nady	B	Nady	Xavier_Nady	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Nady	000	000
hit
pretty
well
against
right-handed
pitching
this
year
,
going
.274
/
.322
/
.479
.

One
problem
,
though
,
was
that
he
hit
about
the
same
against
left-handed
pitching
and
,
against
lefties
,
was
significantly
worse
than
his
career
averages
.

That
's
a
shame
because
Nady	B	Nady	Xavier_Nady	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Nady	000	000
could
form
a
heck
of
a
platoon
with
Ryan	B	Ryan Doumit	Ryan_Doumit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Doumit	000	000
Doumit	I	Ryan Doumit	Ryan_Doumit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Doumit	000	000
if
Nady	B	Nady	Xavier_Nady	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Nady	000	000
went
back
to
his
lefty-killing
ways
and
Doumit	B	Doumit	Ryan_Doumit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Doumit	000	000
stayed
healthy.In
truth
,
Nady	B	Nady	Xavier_Nady	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Nady	000	000
's
splits
this
year
probably
do
n't
mean
a
whole
lot
.

He
probably
will
go
back
to
hitting
lefties
better
than
righties
.

And
let
's
hope
he
does
,
because
consistency
should
n't
be
high
on
the
list
of
things
we
want
from
Nady	B	Nady	Xavier_Nady	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Nady	000	000
.

His
105
OPS
+
this
year
is
only
a
notch
above
average
for
a
rightfielder
,
he
's
not
a
great
defender
,
and
he
probably
wo
n't
stay
healthy
.

(
The
concussion
and
digestive
problems
he
suffered
this
year
probably
wo
n't
bother
him
again
,
but
his
hamstring
could
continue
to
be
an
issue
.
)

Nady	B	Nady	Xavier_Nady	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Nady	000	000
's
useful
,
but
he
's
a
role
player
,
not
a
star
.

From
a
player
like
that
,
you
should
hope
for
huge
platoon
splits
,
because
that
's
an
inconsistency
that
's
exploitable
.

If
Nady	B	Nady	Xavier_Nady	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Nady	000	000
puts
up
a
1.000
OPS
against
lefties
and
a
.750
OPS
against
righties
,
and
Doumit	B	Doumit	Ryan_Doumit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Doumit	000	000
puts
up
an
.865
OPS
against
righties
like
he
did
last
year
,
then
the
Pirates	B	Pirates	Pittsburgh_Pirates	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates	000	000
have
one
of
the
best
offensive
right-field
tandems
in
baseball
even
if
Doumit	B	Doumit	Ryan_Doumit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Doumit	000	000
is
hurt
half
the
time
like
usual
.

As
it
stands
now
,
they
're
just
a
little
above
average
.

Platoon
splits

For
RHBs
,
platoon
splits
all
converge
toward
the
same
ratio
with
additional
playing
time
.

This
sounds
crazy
,
but
it
's
actually
pretty
well
documented
.

Lefties
and
switch-hitters
do
n't
do
so
,
for
reasons
that
remain
largely
speculative
.

As
such
,
Nady	B	Nady	Xavier_Nady	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Nady	000	000
's
platoon
splits
over
the
next
few
years
should
n't
be
too
tough
to
model
.

Vlad
,

Have
you
ever
seen
an
explanation
for
the
platoon
advantage
?

Does
it
have
to
do
with
seeing
the
ball
better
from
one
side
or
another
?

That
seems
kind
of
counterintuitive
to
me
,
because
it
seems
like
a
RH
batter
would
get
a
better
view
of
the
ball
from
a
pitcher
's
right
hand
.

Does
it
have
to
do
with
ball
movement
,
pitches
from
RHPs
generally
moving
away
from
right-handed
batters
and
vice
versa
?

I
'm
not
debating
that
the
platoon
edge
exist
,
it
certainly
does
.

But
I
do
n't
think
I
've
ever
seen
anyone
try
to
explain
why
.

Nothing
analytical
.

If
you
wanted
to
break
it
down
,
there
might
be
a
way
to
screen
any
"
picking
up
the
ball
effect
"
from
a
"
ball
movement
"
effect
.

Actually
,
there
are
two
potential
ball
movement
effects
:
The
one
from
the
location
of
a
release
point
on
one
side
of
the
mound
or
the
other
,
and
the
one
from
the
direction
of
motion
on
breaking
balls
(
since
basically
nobody
throws
a
screwball
nowadays
)
.

The
easiest
way
to
do
things
might
be
to
chart
pitches
for
a
low-level
kids
'
league
and
see
whether
guys
there
still
have
a
platoon
split
.

If
they
do
,
it
's
ball
movement
from
release
point
,
since
LL	B	LL	LL_Cool_J	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_Cool_J	000	000
kids
do
n't
have
much
deception
or
any
breaking
ball
.

To
screen
for
the
breaking
ball
effect
,
you
could
maybe
pull
a
sample
of
notable
screwball
pitchers
,
match
them
up
with
non-screwball
equivalents
who
throw
from
the
same
side
,
and
see
whether
there
's
a
difference
in
platoon
split.It
's
an
interesting
question
.

This
might
be
oversimplifying

What
Vlad
writes
below
may
be
true
,
at
least
in
part
,
but
I
think
there
's
a
pretty
simple
explanation
:
the
caveman
instinct
of
fight
or
flight
.

Mostly
flight
.

A
pitch
from
a
righty
to
a
righty
or
lefty
to
lefty
,
looks
to
the
batter
like
it
will
hit
him
in
the
head
.

It
's
why
guys
get
their
knees
buckled
,
or
bail
out
.

Think
Randy	B	Randy Johnson	Randy_Johnson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Johnson	000	000
Johnson	I	Randy Johnson	Randy_Johnson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Johnson	000	000
vs.
Kruk
or
Larry	B	Larry Walker	Larry_Walker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Walker	000	000
Walker	I	Larry Walker	Larry_Walker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Walker	000	000
.

Yes
,
he
did
throw
over
their
heads
,
but
the
reason
it
works
is
because
almost
ANY
pitch
he
throws
will
appear
that
way
at
release
.

Johnson	B	Johnson	Randy_Johnson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Johnson	000	000
is
an
extreme
example
because
he
was
very
tall
and
his
motion
was
n't
anywhere
near
over
the
top
.

To
lefties
,
his
pitches
have
to
cross
their
body
,
so
to
speak
,
before
reaching
the
plate
.

Even
if
a
batter
does
n't
conciously
think
about
getting
hit
,
it
's
a
natural
self-defense
mechanism
to
shy
from
a
95mph
pitch
.

Even
if
you
ca
n't
see
the
batter
bail
out
or
flinch
,
there
is
something
inside
the
human
body
that
is
freezing
it
.

It
's
something
that
separates
the
good
from
the
great
,
the
ability
to
fight
that
natural
mechancism
.

If
you
've
ever
wondered
why
so-and-so
let
a
fastball
go
right
down
the
middle
for
strike
three
,
sometimes
this
is
the
reason
.

Except

that

I

While
I
'm
trying

to
remember
what
I
forgot
,
it
seems
to
me
azibuck
's
theory
would
be
fairly
easy
to
gather
evidence
for
(
not
for
me
,
I
do
n't
have
anything
like
the
software
needed
,
but
maybe
one
of
you
does
?
)

.

Let
's
say
intimidation/fear
was
a
big
part
of
it
.

It
should
be
a
simple
matter
of
splitting
pitchers
into
two
or
three
groups
:
high-strikeout
,

Nady/Doumit
Platoon
is
a
Good
Idea

I
agree
that
platooning
these
two
is
good
idea
.

We
are
short
on
outfielders
that
can
hit
so
why
not
make
one
better
than
average
one
out
of
two
less
than
average
ones
?

It
worked
in
1979
with
Milner/Robinson
who
did
not
field
well
but
combined
to
a
make
a
power
hitting
combination
.

They
combined
for
40
HRs
and
135
RBIs
.

Though
some
of
Milner
's
time
was
at
1st	B	1st Base	First_baseman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman	000	000
Base	I	1st Base	First_baseman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman	000	000
replacing
Willie.Also
,
I
do
n't
see
either
guy
complaining
too
much
plus
they
both
can
hit
off
the
bench
.

One
drawback
is
they
both
do
n't
field
real
well
.

But
the
Pirates	B	Pirates	Pittsburgh_Pirates	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates	000	000
need
hitters
right
now
.

I
still
think
...

...
that
not
using
Doumit	B	Doumit	Ryan_Doumit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Doumit	000	000
behind
the
plate
is
a
huge
waste
.

That
said
,
if
they
've
given
up
on
him
there
,
and
if
they
hang
onto
Nady	B	Nady	Xavier_Nady	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Nady	000	000
this
offseason
,
a
platoon
with
Nady	B	Nady	Xavier_Nady	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Nady	000	000
would
n't
be
a
bad
idea
.

Yeah
...

I
'd
still
like
to
see
Doumit	B	Doumit	Ryan_Doumit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Doumit	000	000
catch
.

Given
the
new
front
office
,
it
might
actually
happen
.

I
guess
I
'd
just
taken
Paulino
's
continued
presence
behind
the
plate
as
a
given
,
but
there
's
no
reason
to
do
that
anymore
.

You
could
also
platoon
Paulino
and
Doumit	B	Doumit	Ryan_Doumit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Doumit	000	000
.

That
might
be
even
more
helpful
than
Nady	B	Nady	Ryan_Doumit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Doumit	000	000
/
Doumit	B	Doumit	Ryan_Doumit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Doumit	000	000
platoon

that

will
return
to
Saskatchewan	B	Saskatchewan	Saskatchewan_Roughriders	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan_Roughriders	000	000
as
defensive

.

“
It
feels
good
,
”
a
grinning
Hall	B	Hall	Richie_Hall	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Hall	000	000
told
reporters
.

“
It
feels
a
little
intimidating
just
because
they
've
have
so
much
success
the
last
couple
of
years
,
going
to
Grey	B	Grey Cup	Grey_Cup	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Cup	000	000
Cup	I	Grey Cup	Grey_Cup	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Cup	000	000

(
in
a

)
.

You
feel
that
you
want
to
continue
that
tradition
that
they
have
already
established
.
”

Hall	B	Hall	Richie_Hall	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Hall	000	000
was
a
part
of
the
green
and
white
coaching
staff
for
15
seasons
,
including
eight
as
defensive
co-ordinator
.

He
helped
the
Riders
win
the
Grey	B	Grey Cup	Grey_Cup	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Cup	000	000
Cup	I	Grey Cup	Grey_Cup	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Cup	000	000

Hall	B	Hall	Richie_Hall	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Hall	000	000
left
Saskatchewan	B	Saskatchewan	Saskatchewan_Roughriders	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan_Roughriders	000	000
in
2009
to
become
head
coach
and
defensive
co-ordinator
of
the
Edmonton	B	Edmonton Eskimos	Edmonton_Eskimos	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Eskimos	000	000
Eskimos	I	Edmonton Eskimos	Edmonton_Eskimos	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Eskimos	000	000
.

He
was
embraced
by
Edmonton	B	Edmonton	Edmonton_Eskimos	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Eskimos	000	000
fans
and
players
alike
for
his
ready
grin
and
relentless
optimism
,
but
that
was
n't
enough
to
offset
a
losing
record.He
was
fired
by
the
Eskimos	B	Eskimos	Edmonton_Eskimos	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Eskimos	000	000
in
November
after
Edmonton	B	Edmonton	Edmonton_Eskimos	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Eskimos	000	000
finished
with
a
7-11
record
last
season
and
missed
the
playoffs.It
was
a
learning
experience
.

“
I
think
it
's
changed
you
,
but
I
do
n't
know
if
it
changed
me
because
I
've
been
the
head
coach
.

I
think
it
's
just
the
last
two
years
of
experience
,
as
far
as
the
things
that
I
've
endured
,
that
makes
you
either
bitter
or
makes
you
better
.

And
I
always
think
that
your
experiences
make
you
a
better
person
,
”
said
Hall	B	Hall	Richie_Hall	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Hall	000	000
.

“
I
like
to
think
that
I
'm
better
today
than
I
was
yesterday
.
”

Before
moving
into
coaching
,
Hall	B	Hall	Richie_Hall	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Hall	000	000
spent
nine
years
playing
in
the
CFL
,
including
four
seasons
with
the
Roughriders	B	Roughriders	Saskatchewan_Roughriders	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan_Roughriders	000	000
from
1988
to
1991

Hall	B	Hall	Richie_Hall	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Hall	000	000
said
he
does
n't
think
going
from
a
head
coach
position
to
defensive
co-ordinator
is
a
step
backwards
.

“
I
've
always
looked
at
it
as
just
to
have
the
opportunity
to
do
something
that
you
enjoy
doing
and
that
's
coaching
,
”
he
said
.

“
Whether
it
's
being
a
position
coach
,
whether
it
's
being
a
co-ordinator
or
whether
it
's
being
a
head
coach
,
I
get
the
luxury
of
doing
something
that
I
enjoy
doing
.

It
does
n't
matter
what
my
role
is
,
but
to
be
able
to
coach
I
think
that
's
a
lot
of
fun

this
is
a
better
move
than
what
edmonton
did
,
signing
kavis
reed
as
a
head
coach
,
did
you
see
how
bad
our
defense
was
last
year
?

i

Erik
Stinnett

You
know
early
Friday
afternoon
,
Bama
fans
--
or
at
least
the
majority
of
Bama
fans
--
had
one
question
on
their
minds
.

How
many
more
days
until
spring
football
?

Basketball
?

Enough
already
.

Time
to
move
on
.

Oh
sure
,
Bama
was
playing
at
the
time
.

Its

first
game
in
the
SEC
Tournament
.

A
pivotal
,
super-important
second-round
matchup
with

Georgia	B	Georgia	Georgia_Bulldogs_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football	000	000
.

In
the
eyes
of
many
,
this
was
an
NCAA	B	NCAA Tournament	NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	000	000
Tournament	I	NCAA Tournament	NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	000	000
play-out
game

for
the
loser
,
especially
if
that
loser
was
Bama
.

And
with
seven
minutes

left
in
the
second
half
,
Bama
trailed
by
14
.

As
in
1-4
.

As
in
two

touchdowns
.

As
in
not
coming
back
.

As
in
this
game
's
over
.

In
fact
,
it

looked
like
the
beating
was
going
to
get
worse
.

This
was
Gainesville	B	Gainesville	Gainesville,_Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida	000	000
,

Part
II
.

This
was
another
egg-laying
performance
by
the
Tide
in
another

high-stakes
,
big
stage
setting
.

Hmmm
.

AJ	B	AJ	Aaron_Ross	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Ross	000	000
or
Phillip
.

Wonder
how

good
Aaron
Douglas
is
going
to
look
at
left
tackle
.

Heard
A-Day
is
going

to
be
on
ESPNU	B	ESPNU	ESPNU	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPNU	000	000
this
spring
.

Then
JaMychal	B	JaMychal Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
Green	I	JaMychal Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
hit
a
pair
of
free
throws
.

Trey	B	Trey Thompkins	Trey_Thompkins	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Thompkins	000	000
Thompkins	I	Trey Thompkins	Trey_Thompkins	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Thompkins	000	000
hit
one
for
Georgia	B	Georgia	Georgia_Bulldogs_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football	000	000
.

Thirteen-point
lead
.

Wonder
why
Nick	B	Nick Saban	Nick_Saban	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban	000	000
Saban	I	Nick Saban	Nick_Saban	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban	000	000
always
wears
a
suit
on
A-Day
.

Wonder
if
he
's
calling
a
high
school
coach
right
about
now
regarding
a
recruit
.

Another

by
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
.

Hey
,
it
's
a
seven-point
game
now
with
3:37
to
play
.

Is
it

possible
that
...
I
mean
could
Bama
really
...
Or
is
this
just
a
big

tease
.

If
nothing
else
,
at
least
Bama
is
making
it
respectable
,
right
?

free

.

A
Davis
layup
.

Are
you
kidding
?

A

four-point
game
with
three
minutes
to
play
.

It
looked
like
Georgia	B	Georgia	Georgia_Bulldogs_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football	000	000

had
awoken
just
in
time
when
Thompkins	B	Thompkins	Trey_Thompkins	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Thompkins	000	000
converted
a
three-point
play

with
2:49
to
play
to
push
the
lead
back
to
seven
,
but
Bama
answered

right
back
with
a
Davis
trey
to
cut
it
to
four
again
.

This
Tide
team

was
n't
going
to
go
away
.

Spring
football
?

Uh
...
maybe
that
talk
can
wait
.

Bama

trailed
by
two
when
Releford	B	Releford	Trevor_Releford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Releford	000	000
showed
some
late-game
moxie
by
driving

through
heavy
traffic
in
the
lane
and
scooping
a
tying
basket
off
the

glass
with
a
mere
4.2
seconds
to
play
.

It
looked
for
a
brief

second
like
Georgia	B	Georgia	Georgia_Bulldogs_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football	000	000
had
pulled
off
the
great
escape
when
Dustin
Ware
threw
up
a
desperation
,
long-range
3-pointer
with
under
a
second
to
play
,
and
it
went
in
.

But
Georgia	B	Georgia	Georgia_Bulldogs_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football	000	000
coach

Mark	B	Mark Fox	Mark_Fox_(basketball)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fox_(basketball)	000	000
Fox	I	Mark Fox	Mark_Fox_(basketball)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Fox_(basketball)	000	000
had
called
timeout
and
was
granted
that
timeout
prior
to
Ware

releasing
the
shot
.

With
.8
seconds
to
play
,
Thompkins	B	Thompkins	Trey_Thompkins	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Thompkins	000	000
heaved
up
an

airball
.

Overtime
.

Bama
,
which
had
NIT
written
all
over
it
just
a
few
minutes
earlier
,
had
new
life
.

In

overtime
,
the
Tide
continued
to
hang
close
.

Finally
,
with
2:44
left
,

Chris	B	Chris Hines	Chris_Hines	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hines	000	000
Hines	I	Chris Hines	Chris_Hines	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hines	000	000
scored
to
give
Bama
a
59-58
advantage
.

The
Tide
's
first
lead

since
being
up
9-8
early
in
the
game
.

Yeah
,
it
had
been
that
long
.

A

Ware
free-throw
knotted
it
back
up
at
59-59
.

Then
,
with
1:32
showing
on

the
clock
,
Tony	B	Tony Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
Mitchell	I	Tony Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
seized
the
moment
by
stepping
up
and
knocking

down
a
huge
3-pointer
.

It
proved
to
be
the
game-winner
.

It
also
may
prove
to
be
the
shot

that
saved
Bama
's
NCAA	B	NCAA Tournament	NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	000	000
Tournament	I	NCAA Tournament	NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	000	000
hopes
.

The
Tide
went
on
to
win

Saturday
,
65-59
,
and
talk
now
is
that
that
victory
--
the
Tide
's
fifth

this
season
over
a
foe
from
the
big
,
bad
SEC
Eastern	B	Eastern Division	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
Division	I	Eastern Division	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
--
just

may
have
catapulted
Bama
,
now
21-10
,
into
the
Big	B	Big Dance	NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	000	000

Lunardi	I	Joe Lunardi	Joe_Lunardi	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Lunardi	000	000
is
now
projecting
Bama
as
one
of
the
last
four
teams
in

and
Georgia	B	Georgia	Georgia_Bulldogs_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_football	000	000
,
21-11
,
as
one
of
the
last
four
teams
out
.

Whatever
it
did
as
far
as
Bama
's

Grant	I	Anthony Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
's
squad
look
good
.

Two
more
wins
and
Bama
wo
n't
need
a

selection
committee
to
decide
its
fate
.

The
Tide
moves
on
now
to
the

SEC
Tournament
semifinals
--
its
deepest
run
in
the
tourney
since
'05
--

and
will
take
on
Kentucky	B	Kentucky	Kentucky_Wildcats_men's_basketball	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Wildcats_men's_basketball	000	000
at
noon
CT
Saturday
.

The
finals
are
set
for
noon

Sunday

field
scheduled
to
be
announced
later
Sunday
.

And

speaking
of
fate
,
do
n't
tell
Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
there
's
no
such
thing
.

When
asked

after
the
game
about
how
the
game
played
out
in
Bama
's
favor
late
in

regulation
and
then
in
overtime
,
he
replied
,
"
It
's
fate
,
I
guess
.
"

But
this
Tide
team
,
characterized
by
its
tenacity
,
will
and
fight
throughout
the
second
half
of
the
season
,
did
its
part
,
too
.
"

We

stayed
the
course
,
"
Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
said

the
amazing
comeback

Geography
:

Faridabad
City
itself
is
a
plain
bordered
by
the

River	B	River Yamuna	Yamuna	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamuna	000	000

the
land
east
of
the

Highway	I	National Highway	National_Highway_(India)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_(India)	000	000

is
better
in
quality
than
the
western
side
.

Today

virtually
all
of
the
land
has
been
filled
up
with

residential
housing

rely
on
ground
water
for
their
basic
needs
which

is
the
gift
of
good
monsoon
season
.

In
Faridabad	B	Faridabad	Faridabad	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faridabad	000	000

most
of
the
population
is
Sikhs	B	Sikhs	Sikh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh	000	000

run
mainly
on
national

highway
connecting

border
and
Ballabgarh	B	Ballabgarh	Ballabhgarh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballabhgarh	000	000
.

Likewise
other
means
of
transport
are

cause
of

Essential
swag
for
your
4th
of
July
party

By
Max
on
June
28

The
4th
of
July
is
a
time
of
celebration
,
friendship
,
and
family
.

All
over
the
nation
people
will
be
getting
together
for
a
day
of
revelry
,
barbecuing
,
fairs
,
parades
,
concerts
and
baseball
games
.

Clearly
this
is
an
important
day
,
a
day
to
bring
your
game
face
and
show
your
neighbors
that
you
too
continue
to
hold
an
unreasonable
predilection
for
hating
Great
Britain
and
the
red
coats
of
yester-century
.

It
’s
imperative
then
,
that
on
such
an
esteemed
day
you
are
as
well
prepared
to
party
as
Paul
Revere
was
for
his
midnight
ride
.

Here
’s
some
crucial
items
you
absolutely
must
have
to
ensure
that
your
4th
of
July
celebration
goes
off
without
a
hitch
:

Fireworks
Popcorn
Giftbox
:
We
would
of
course
never
advocate
using
or
even
owning
dangerous
and
illegal
fireworks
,
but
with
this
fireworks
themed
popcorn
,
you
can
make
all
the
noise
without
any
of
the
catastrophe
or
lost
limbs
.

This
particular
set
features
four
succulent
varieties
of
“

grade
American	B	American	All-America	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America	000	000
popcorn
grown
right
in
the
heartland

re-opens
the
debate
about
a
need
for
a
transfer
system
in
cricket
.

©
Action
ImagesCounty
cricket
is
at
a
crossroads
.

Does
it
go
the
way
of
football
and
allow
the
moneyed
clubs
to
procure
all
the
best
and
brightest
young
talent
,
thus
making
any
battle
for
trophies
a
three
or
four-horse
race
?

Does
it
want
to
lose
its
long
and
proud
tradition
whereby
any
of
the
18
counties
can
realistically
win
the
Championship	B	Championship	Football_League_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Championship	000	000
?

In
short
,
does
our
summer
game
want
to
fully
embrace
capitalism
and
all
the
free-market
obligations
that
that
entails
?

I
think
most
fans
of
the
county
game
would
answer
no
to
those
questions
.

We
want
to
retain
the
competitiveness
that
has
given
us
gripping
climaxes
to
last
two
county
seasons
.

And
we
want
to
be
charmed
by
the
heart-warming
stories
of
cash-strapped
clubs
being
led
to
title
glory
by
long-serving
and
loyal
legends
of
the
game
.

So
what
is
the
solution
?

Winston	B	Winston Churchill	Winston_Churchill	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill	000	000
Churchill	I	Winston Churchill	Winston_Churchill	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill	000	000
once
said
that
capitalism
is
the
unequal
sharing
of
blessings
.

In
the
case
of
cricket
clubs
those
blessings
are
the
likes
of
the
Taylors
,
the
Denlys
,
and
,
who
knows
,
in
the
future
,
the
Shiv
Thakors
and
the
Reece
Topleys
.

In
a
normal
profession
those
players
would
naturally
gravitate
towards
the
best
paid
jobs
and
leave
their
educators
,
usually
the
state
,
behind
.

They
would
then
,
of
course
,
reward
those
educators
for
their
efforts
in
the
form
of
taxes
and
that
money
would
then
be
used
to
train
the
next
generation
--
and
so
the
cycle
continues
.

In
cricket
,
unlike
even
in
premiership
football
-
that
Mecca	B	Mecca	Mecca	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca	000	000
to
capitalism
-
this
does
n’t
happen
.

The
likes
of
Leicestershire	B	Leicestershire	Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club	000	000
or
Kent	B	Kent	Kent_County_Cricket_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_County_Cricket_Club	000	000
do
not
currently
receive
any
of
football
’s
compensation
or
solidarity
payments
when
they
lose
their
best
and
brightest
young
talent
to
the
Manchester
Uniteds
of
cricket
,
meaning
that
they
suffer
a
gradual
depletion
of
their
resources
which
causes
the
problems
to
escalate
.

Until
recently
,
this
lack
of
reward
did
n’t
matter
as
players
were
reluctant
to
move
clubs
and
the
financial
rewards
for
staging
international
cricket
--
the
single
most
important
factor
in
making
some
clubs
so
rich
-
were
not
so
high
.

That
has
all
changed
over
the
past
decade
or
so
,
with
the
likes
of
Test
match
endowed
Surrey	B	Surrey	Surrey_County_Cricket_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club	000	000
now
able
to
spend
three
times
as
much
as
the
likes
of
Test
matchless
Kent
on
player
salaries
.

This
means
that
,
as
well
as
producing
their
own
players
,
Surrey	B	Surrey	Surrey_County_Cricket_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club	000	000
are
able
to
poach
the
best
young
talent
from
the
smaller
counties
without
paying
any
form
of
compensation
for
the
training
and
nurturing
that
the
player
has
received
through
that
county
’s
Academy
system
.

Numerous
moves
have
been
suggested
over
the
past
few
years
,
including
salary
caps
and
the
like
,
but
nothing
has
really
changed
the
view
that
county
cricket
is
sleepwalking
into
a
two-tier
oblivion
.

Perhaps
the
only
answer
is
to
adopt
a
transfer
system
similar
to
that
used
in
football
--
only
to
perhaps
go
further
--
so
that
the
smaller
counties
can
be
compensated
for
their
losses
.

After
all
,
the
principle
aim
of
counties
--
unlike
for
premiership
football
teams
-
is
not
to
win
trophies
but
to
produce
England	B	England	England_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team	000	000
players
,
so
why
should
Leicestershire
et
al
be
penalised
financially
for
doing
just
that
?

Though
he
had
kept
a
detailed
diary
during
these
missions
,
few
of
his
lifelong
friends
knew
of
this
honor
.

Before

businesses
year
.

All
of
these
businesses
still
exist
and
have
been
successfully
managed
by
his
son
,
Ernie
,
for
the
past
19
years
.

Bankers
attempting
to
establish
a
second
bank
in
Estes
Park
approached
this
business
and
community
leader
to
be
an
initial
investor
and
board
member
,
thus
Pep
served
on
the
board
of
directors
of
the
First
National
Bank
of
Estes
Park
for
the
next
40
years

Pep
's
passion
for
golf
brought
him
the
honor
of
being
the
very
first
president
of
the
Estes
Park
Men
's
Golf
Association
.

In
the
1970s
,
this
passion
was
replaced
by
tennis
.

He
excelled
at
both
sports
,
as
he
did
in
business
.

Back
problems
took
him
off
the
courts
a
few
years
ago
and
he
had
to
again
polish
his
ping-pong
skills
learned
between
bombing
missions
in
WWII	B	WWII	World_War_II	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II	000	000
.

He
played
on
the
Estes
Park
Men
's
Basketball
team
in
the
early
1950s
,
competing
with
other
Front
Range
teams
.

Having
been
a
lifeguard
in
high
school
,
he
enjoyed
swimming
all
his
life
.

The
ever-community-minded
and
generous
leader
was
a
member
of
the
E.P.
Rotary	B	Rotary Club	Rotary_International	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_International	000	000
Club	I	Rotary Club	Rotary_International	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_International	000	000
for
more
than
50
years
,
where
he
also
served
on
the
board
of
directors
.

He
was
a
one-time
member
of
the
E.P.
Lions	B	Lions Club	Lions_Clubs_International	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Clubs_International	000	000
Club	I	Lions Club	Lions_Clubs_International	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Clubs_International	000	000
.

As
a
progressive
businessman
,
he
operated
,
possibly
,
the
first
computer
in
Estes	B	Estes Park	Estes_Park,_Colorado	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Park,_Colorado	000	000
Park	I	Estes Park	Estes_Park,_Colorado	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Park,_Colorado	000	000
.

During
and
after
the
transition
of
the
corporate
management
to
son
Ernie
,
Pep
started
the
first
computer
store
in
Estes	B	Estes Park	Estes_Park,_Colorado	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Park,_Colorado	000	000
Park	I	Estes Park	Estes_Park,_Colorado	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estes_Park,_Colorado	000	000
,
repairing

He
eventually
convinced

Duo
improvisations
featuring
a
double
bass
and
a
horn
are
some
of
the

hardest
performances
to
realize
.

The
challenge
is
compounded
if
the
non-bass-playing

partner
only
has
a
trumpet
's
three
valves
and
his
embouchure
with
which

to
create
.

few
feet
from

a
performer
in
a
live
setting
,
reveals
its
flaws
and
shortcomings
when

exposed
to
the
light
of
a
laser
.

This
is
what
happens
throughout
Duocity

in
Brass
&
Wood
.

Compounding
the
weakness
is
the
hour
plus
running

time
of
each
CD
.

Lacking
the
visuals
and
personal
interaction
,
aural
hard

slogging
can
result
with
only
three
valves
and
four
strings
on
show
.

This

is
brought
into
starker
focus
when
you
compare
Smoker	B	Smoker	Paul_Smoker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Smoker	000	000
's
session
with
Duval	B	Duval	Dominic_Duval	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Duval	000	000
's

duet
with
reedist
Mark	B	Mark Whitecage	Mark_Whitecage	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Whitecage	000	000
Whitecage	I	Mark Whitecage	Mark_Whitecage	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Whitecage	000	000
on
Rules
of
Engagement
.

Not
only
does

Whitecage
divide
his
responses
among
clarinet
,
soprano
and
alto
saxophones
,

each
one
of
which
is
capable
of
creating
more
textures
than
a
trumpet
,

but
the
entire
studio
session
does
n't
wear
out
its
welcome
--
it
's
over

in
less
than
44
minutes
.

Also
,
while
the
11
trumpet-bass
duets
are
instant

compositions
,
Duval	B	Duval	Dominic_Duval	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Duval	000	000
wrote
all
the
duo
tunes
on
the
other
CD
.

Performing

for
the
first
time
as
a
duo
and
with
not
many
previous
encounters
under

their
respective
belts
,
Smoker	B	Smoker	Paul_Smoker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Smoker	000	000
and
Duval	B	Duval	Dominic_Duval	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Duval	000	000
spend
most
of
the
time
on
the

seven
tracks
playing
slow-moving
themes
to
determine
each
other
's
skills
.

In
the
case
of
the
trumpeter
especially
,
this
seems
to
involve
extended

techniques
that
at
time
stray
close
to
the
show-offy
.

On
"

Burn
Dialogue/Blue
Monk
,
"
the
nearly
131/2-minute
longest
track

for
instance
,
he
begins
a
cappella
with
a
capricious
display
of
growls

and
chromatic
high-pitched
note
bending
.

Just
before
the
solo
threatens

to
turn
into
a
Maynard	B	Maynard Ferguson	Maynard_Ferguson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynard_Ferguson	000	000
Ferguson	I	Maynard Ferguson	Maynard_Ferguson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maynard_Ferguson	000	000
style
extravaganza
,
it
finally
become

a
hell-bent-for-leather
dialogue
between
Smoker	B	Smoker	Paul_Smoker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Smoker	000	000
's
chromatic
trills
and

Duval	B	Duval	Dominic_Duval	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Duval	000	000
's
slower-paced
,
carefully
emphasized
arco
work
.

As
the
bassist
bows

away
the
trumpeter
decorates
the
output
with
shrill
high
notes
and
a
line

that
sounds
like
"
Cherokee
"
played
at
a
languid
pace
.

There
's

no
mistaking
"
Blue
Monk
,
"
which
soon
appears
in
proper
cadence

here
,
replete
with
plunger
trills
.

As
Smoker	B	Smoker	Paul_Smoker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Smoker	000	000
dispenses
his
variations

on
the
theme
,
Duval	B	Duval	Dominic_Duval	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Duval	000	000
counters
with
pealing
,
pizzicato
strokes
that
offer

a
sandpaper
rough
version
of
the
same
thing
.

Other

than
a
singing
version
of
"
If
I
Were
A	B	A Bell	Aaron_Bell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Bell	000	000
Bell	I	A Bell	Aaron_Bell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Bell	000	000
"
presented
in
a

muted
Milesean
fashion
,
the
tunes
concentrate
on
brass
and
bass
effects
.

At
one
point
Smoker	B	Smoker	Paul_Smoker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Smoker	000	000
warbles
offbeat
slurring
phrases
as
Duval	B	Duval	Dominic_Duval	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Duval	000	000
introduces

well-modulated
triple
stops
;
at
another
four-string
strums
from
the
bassman

calls
forth
echoes
that
could
come
from
an
Alpine	B	Alpine	Alpine_skiing	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_skiing	000	000
horn
-
then
choked
valve

plunger
work
examination
.

Fittingly
,

the
final
tune
is
both
abstract
and
conventional
.

Initially
it
resounds

with
idiosyncratic
brass
note
flurries
that
go
from
andante
to
adagio

to
allegro
,
as
the
bass
line
becomes
excessively
discordant
.

The
ending

however
finds
Smoker	B	Smoker	Paul_Smoker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Smoker	000	000
appropriately
quoting
"
The
Party
's
Over
"

in
mid-register
,
Bobby	B	Bobby Hackett	Bobby_Hackett	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Hackett	000	000
Hackett	I	Bobby Hackett	Bobby_Hackett	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Hackett	000	000
-
like
fashion
.

Over-abundant

experimentation
also
characterizes
the
four
Schuller	B	Schuller	Ed_Schuller	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Schuller	000	000
/
Smoker
duets
,
with

the
others
leading
up
to
and
away
from
"
Hypnotics/Bassoptics
Mutetics/Nostematics
,
"

an
almost
31-minute
tour
de
force
.

Separated
by
periods
of
silence
and

applause
,
the
first
section
showcases
legato
trumpeting
with
thundering

bass
lines
that
get
harder
,
stronger
and
more
repetitive
as
Smoker	B	Smoker	Paul_Smoker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Smoker	000	000
shrilly

whistles
from
his
mouthpiece
.

As
Schuller	B	Schuller	Ed_Schuller	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Schuller	000	000
strongarms
a
vamping
ostinato

back
and
forth
,
the
trumpeter
buzzes
grit
from
his
valves
and
soon
broaches

mouthpiece
kisses
,
small
smacks
then
squeals
.

Following
a
pause
,
a
dark
,

double-stopping
bass
solo
seems
to
invite
Smoker	B	Smoker	Paul_Smoker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Smoker	000	000
's
most
idiosyncratic

response
as
higher-pitched
,
Harmon-muted
obbligatos
share
space
with
deeper

open
tones
.

It
almost
appears
as
if
he
's
playing
two
trumpets
at
once
.

As
Schuller	B	Schuller	Ed_Schuller	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Schuller	000	000
continues
to
snap
out
short
melodies
and
decorative
asides

that
then
turn
to
a
walking
bass
line
,
Smoker	B	Smoker	Paul_Smoker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Smoker	000	000
completes
the
showcase
with

a
flourish
,
producing
a
steady

buzz

from

"

is
the
most
interesting
of
the
pieces
--
not
to
mention
the
shortest
--

since
Smoker	B	Smoker	Paul_Smoker	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Smoker	000	000
manages
to

horn
sounds
from
his
axe
,
not
to
mention
vocalized
plunger
inflections

straight
out
of
the
Bubber
Miley
Jungle
book
.

Meanwhile
Schuller	B	Schuller	Ed_Schuller	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Schuller	000	000
moves

from
assured
,
low-pitched
arco
thrusts
to
split
second
visits
to
the
effervescent

cello
register
.

Trumpet

and
or
bass
aficionados
may
get
the
most
from
these
duets
,
a
limitation

you
do
n't
have
to
ascribe
to
Rules
of
Engagement
,
though
you
can
only

get

years

Rosen	I	Jay Rosen	Jay_Rosen_(drummer)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Rosen_(drummer)	000	000
.

That
,
of
course
,
is
when
the

bassist
is
n't
busy
with
many
of
his
other
projects
including

gigs

,

whose
experience
as
a
multi-reedist
goes
back
to

1960s
,
has
to
take

a
back
seat
to
anyone
.

He
's
suitably
expressive
on

of

horns

on

tracks

melody
.

Beginning
with
blurting

irregular
tones
from
the
alto
that
meet
rasping
,
bowed
arpeggios
from

the
bass
,
Whitecage
soon
digresses
into
husks
of
the
original
melody
as

Duval	B	Duval	Dominic_Duval	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Duval	000	000
provide
a
unvarying
swing
foundation
.

When
the
saxist
arches
out

shrill
reconstructions
--
speeding
up
and
double-timing
the
theme
--
Duval	B	Duval	Dominic_Duval	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Duval	000	000

answers
with
his
own
sonorous
quotes
,
slowly
sounding
one
note
at
a
time
.
"

Snap

Judgement
"
is
another
alto
feature
for
Whitecage
's
speech-like
inflections
,

Bird	B	Bird	Bird	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird	000	000
-
like
feints
inside
the
horn
and
a
bubbling
,
bluesy
ending
.

True
to

the
title
Duval	B	Duval	Dominic_Duval	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Duval	000	000
constantly
snaps
his
strings
to
such
an
extent
that
you

can
savor
his
precise
note
placement
as
the
tune
moves
from
andante
to

allegro
,
finally
settling
into
ringing
pedal
point
accompaniment
.

Duval	B	Duval	Dominic_Duval	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Duval	000	000
's

bass
work
is
brisk
,
however
,
as
he
strums
with
blurred
fingering
on
"
Katherine

Song

4
.
"

A
reverberating
threnody
,
the
piece
revolves
around
melancholy

expressed
by
Whitecage
's
trilled
soprano
that
extends
barbed
obbligatos

with
intense
vibratos
.

Examples
of
the
reedman

exhibited

This

is
how
the
scorecard
reads
.

Duval	B	Duval	Dominic_Duval	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Duval	000	000
and
Whitecage
have
created
an
altogether

satisfying
session

primarily
focuses
on
developing
students
'
work-readiness
skills
that
prepares
them
for
the
modern

for
an
authentic
real-world
experience
,

had
spent
her
Job

in
the
HR
Department
and
attended
a

She
commented
"
The
interviewee
lacked
confidence
and
basic
work
readiness
skills
that
we
had
been
taught
in
the
classroom
;
therefore

it
was
a
no

During

they
had
a

discovered

understood

Content

Let
me
start
by
saying
that
most
micro-budget
movies
usually

suffer
from
one
or
more
of
the
following
maladies
:

Bad

acting

Bad

direction

Bad

lighting/camerawork

Bad

sound

Bad

editing

The
one
area
,
however
,
where
every
movie
,
no
matter
how
low

the
budget
,
has
the
potential
to
excel
is
in
the
writing
.

Unfortunately
,
far

too
many
filmmakers
give
their
scripts
short
shrift
.

This
is
especially
true
in

a
genre
I
hold
near
and
dear
to
my
heart
,
horror
.

You
see
,
far
too
many

filmmakers
think
that
horror
is
about
shocking
an
audience
,
disturbing
them
,

“
rattling
their
cages
”
.

But
what
they
‘
re
missing
is
that
horror
is
about

ideas
,
challenging
perceptions
,
showing
us
a
mirror
image
of
our
world
that
has

a
jagged
crack
running
right
through
the
center
of
it
.

And
it
’s
through
that
crack
that
the
nightmares
come
...

So
,
how
would
I
describe
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
?

I
think
the
following
adjectives
sum
it
up
quite
nicely
:
confident
,
creepy
,

intelligent
,
mature
,
and
mesmerizing
.

And
despite
a
couple
lighting
issues
(
see

the
Visual
Look
section
below
)
,
this
movie
is
an
example
to
all

micro-filmmakers
of
what
is
possible
if
you
have
the
talent
and
drive
to
tell

an
intelligent
story
using
the
resources
available
to
you
.

I
do
n’t
want
to
give
away
too
much
about
the
story
,
but
I

believe
everyone
(
especially
horror
fans
)
owes
it
to
themselves
to
check
it

out
.

It
’s
enough
to
say
that
the
greatness
of
the
script
is
n’t
what
’s

explicitly
stated
or
shown
,
but
rather
what
’s
implied
.

It
’s
the
suggestion
of

character
relationships
and
dynamics
,
allowing
the
audience
to
fill
in
the

gaps
.

I
was
reminded
of
the
Swedish	B	Swedish	Sweden	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden	000	000
vampire
film
Let	B	Let the Right One In	Let_the_Right_One_In_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_the_Right_One_In_(film)	000	000
the	I	Let the Right One In	Let_the_Right_One_In_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_the_Right_One_In_(film)	000	000
Right	I	Let the Right One In	Let_the_Right_One_In_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_the_Right_One_In_(film)	000	000

In	I	Let the Right One In	Let_the_Right_One_In_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_the_Right_One_In_(film)	000	000
,
which
has
a
similar
character-driven
tone
to
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
.

Minor
Spoilers
Ahoy

Take
for
instance
Tricia
’s
pregnancy
.

When
we
first
meet
her

and
learn
that
her
husband
went
missing
seven
years
ago
,
the
question
arises
,

“
Okay
.

So
,
who
’s
the
baby
daddy
?
”

Well
,
through
gradual
reveals
we
come
to

learn
that
Detective
Ryan
Mallory
(
Dave
Levine
)
is
the
father
.

Of
course
,
it
’s

assumed
pretty
early
on
that
he
and
Tricia
are
more
than
just
professionally

connected
,
but
Flanagan
’s
script
never
spells
this
out
.

There
are
very
few

expository
scenes
where
characters
prattle
on
and
on
about
what
has
happened
,

explaining
plot
points
or
motivations
through
dialogue
.

No
,
everything
is
shown

through
actions
!

The
first
rule
of
great
directing
is
great
casting
.

Of

course
,
many
micro-budget
filmmakers
do
n’t
have
access
to
the
talent
pool

director
Flanagan
has
(
he
lives
and
works
in
LA	B	LA	Louisiana	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana	000	000
)
.

But
that
’s
really
just
an

excuse
.

Great
talent
exists
everywhere
.

You
just
have
to
be
willing
to
put
the

work
into
finding
it
.

Great
acting
is
in
the
eyes
.

It
’s
about
an
actor

disappearing
and
becoming
consumed
by
the
character
.

Like
editing
,
sound
,
and

other
elements
,
acting
should
be
seamless
,
never
distracting
,
or
drawing

attention
to
itself
.

It
should
draw
us
into
the
story
,
not
remind
us
that
we
’re

watching
a
movie
.

If
the
character
is
“
real
,
”
living
the
experiences
on
screen
,

then
the
actor
has
done
his
or
her
job
.

This
describes
the
acting
across
the

board
in
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
.

But
after
a
chance
encounter

in
a
tunnel
near
Tricia
's
home
...

...
Something
unexpected

rocks

the
sisters
'
world

.

Lead
Katie
Parker
is
going
to
be
a
star
someday
.

Mark
my

words
.

She
has
that
spark
,
a
rare
mix
of
charm
,
likeability
,
and
sincerity
.

She
’s
beautiful
,
but
not
in
an
inaccessible
way
.

Her
performance
was
real
,

combining
toughness
and
fragility
.

People
are
dying
for
authenticity
,
and
she

has
it
.

I
sincerely
hope
she
never
loses
that
quality
.

Likewise
,
her
co-star

Courtney
Bell
is
a
wonderfully
talented
actress
who
delivers
a
fresh
,

believable
performance
as
Tricia
.

She
was
actually
pregnant
during
the

production
,
which
must
have
made
what
was
an
emotionally
demanding
role
all
the

more
difficult
.

The
chemistry
between
the
two
leads
gave
credibility
to
their

relationship
;
I
really
believed
these
two
were
sisters
who
had
a
history

together
.

Other
honorable
mentions
are
Morgan
Peter
Brown
as
Tricia
’s

missing
husband
,
Daniel
.

Despite
his
limited
screen
time
,
his
presence
is
felt

throughout
the
movie
.

His
character
provides
the
emotional
core
of
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
and
makes
the
threat
of
“
the

thing
in
the
walls
”
seem
very
real
.

Dave
Levine
(
Detective
Mallory
)
and
Justin	B	Justin Gordon	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
Gordon	I	Justin Gordon	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
(
Detective
Lonergan
)
play
what
could
have
been
cop
clichés
,
but
instead
,

created
small
,
real
moments
that
give
their
characters
depth
and
substance
.

And
,
of
course
,
a
real
coup
for
the
film
(
and
one
of
the
definite
advantages
to

being
in
the
City
of
Angels
)
was
getting
notable
character
actor
Doug	B	Doug Jones	Doug_Jones_(actor)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Jones_(actor)	000	000
Jones	I	Doug Jones	Doug_Jones_(actor)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Jones_(actor)	000	000
for

the
role
of
Walter
Lambert
,
a
man
who
disappeared
from
the
neighborhood
years

earlier
.

Jones	B	Jones	Doug_Jones_(actor)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Jones_(actor)	000	000
is
probably
best
known
for
his
roles
as
Abe	B	Abe Sapien	Abe_Sapien	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abe_Sapien	000	000
Sapien	I	Abe Sapien	Abe_Sapien	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abe_Sapien	000	000
in
Hellboy	B	Hellboy	Hellboy_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellboy_(film)	000	000
1
and
2
and
as
the
terrifying

Fauno
and
Pale
Man
in
Pan	B	Pan 's Labyrinth	Pan's_Labyrinth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan's_Labyrinth	000	000
's	I	Pan 's Labyrinth	Pan's_Labyrinth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan's_Labyrinth	000	000
Labyrinth	I	Pan 's Labyrinth	Pan's_Labyrinth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan's_Labyrinth	000	000
.

He
was
also
in
one
of
the
best
hours
of
horror
television
ever
produced
,
playing

one
of
the
Gentlemen
in
the
“
Hush	B	Hush	Hush_(2005_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_(2005_film)	000	000
”
episode
of
Buffy	B	Buffy the Vampire Slayer	Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer	000	000

Slayer	I	Buffy the Vampire Slayer	Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer	000	000
.

And
while
Jones	B	Jones	Doug_Jones_(actor)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Jones_(actor)	000	000
is
amazing
in
these

creature
roles
,
his
brief
,
but
startling
appearance
in
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
proves
he
needs
more
roles
sans
makeup
.

I
could
go
on
and
on
about
the
actors
in
this
movie
.

Even

actors
who
appeared
in
only
one
or
two
scenes
were
memorable
and
only
added
to

the
richness
of
the
story
(
I
’m
specifically
thinking
of
James
Flanagan
as

Walter
’s
son
Jamie
,
Scott
Graham
as
Dr.
Elliot
,
and
Ian
Gregory
and
Connie

Ventress
as
Daniel
’s
parents
)
.

Visual
Look

From
a
technical
perspective
,
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
is
nearly
flawless
.

Absentia
is

directed
with
a
confident
,
sure
hand
and
credit
has
to
go
to
the
Director
of

Photography
(
Rustin
Cerveny
)
as
well
as
director
,
Flanagan
.

The
shot
selection

was
solid
.

Unique
angles
and
differing
perspectives
created
a
feeling
of
unease

throughout
the
film
;
however
,
these
choices
never
felt
awkward
or
forced
.

Solid

camera
direction
is
essential
to
telling
an
effective
visual
story
.

A

poorly-composed
shot
or
violation
of
the
180-degree-rule
can
pull
an
audience

right
out
of
the
story
,
leaving
them
feeling
disengaged
and
unsatisfied
with

the
experience
.

Absentia
,
thankfully
,

never
suffers
from
this
avoidable
misstep
.

There
were
,
however
,
a
few
technical
issues
(
I
did
say
nearly
flawless
after
all
)
.

In
a
few

shots
,
characters
were
backlit
in
a
doorway
or
in
front
of
a
large
,
living
room

window
,
their
faces
cast
in
silhouette
.

This
was
n’t
horribly
distracting
;
it

just
felt
like
it
was
more
the
result
of
limited
lighting
(
i.e.
budgetary

restraints
)
rather
than
specific
artistic
choices
.

An
example
of
where

violating
this
backlighting
“
rule
”
worked
to
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
’s
advantage
was
when
Callie
is
jogging
through
that

ominous
tunnel
.

Several
shots
show
her
at
the
far
end
of
the
tunnel
,

out-of-focus
in
the
background
,
silhouetted
against
a
blinding
white
blaze
of

daylight
.

This
created
an
ethereal
,
otherworldly
feel
and
was
perfect
for

evoking
a
sense
of
the
disjointed
and
alien
nature
of
the
tunnel
itself
.

After
a

night
of
terror
...

.

.

Callie
must
convince

her
sister

about
the
tunnel
.

Speaking
of
the
tunnel
,
it
made
for
a
perfect
location
and

is
a
great
example
of
writing
your
script
around
what
you
have
access
to
.

As
I

understand
it
,
director
Flanagan
came
up
with
the
story
of
Absentia
as
a
way
to
feature
this
creepy
tunnel
,
which
is
located

near
his
home
.

Too
often
,
and
I
’m
guilty
of
this
myself
,
micro-filmmakers
do
n’t

consider
what
they
have
access
to
and
can
use
for
free
.

This
is
essential
if

your
film
is
going
to
get
made
.

The
only
other
problem
,
from
a
technical
perspective
that
I

noticed
was
some
vignetting
around
the
edges
of
the
frame
in
a
few
shots
.

This

was
especially
evident
in
one
scene
that
occurs
late
into
the
film
.

It
involved

two
characters
in
Tricia
’s
house
being
stalked
by
the
creature
(
I
do
n’t
want
to

go
into
too
many
specifics
for
risk
of
spoiling
the
film
)
.

The
scene
in

questions
was
so
taut
with
suspense
,
well-acted
,
and
perfectly
cut
together

that
,
to
be
perfectly
honest
,
I
did
n’t
even
notice
the
vignetting
until
my

second
viewing
.

The
special
effects
in
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
are
understated
and
never
distract
from
the
story
.

At
the
end
of
the
day
,
this

is
a
monster
movie
.

It
reminded
me
of
Guillermo	B	Guillermo Del Toro	Guillermo_del_Toro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro	000	000
Del	I	Guillermo Del Toro	Guillermo_del_Toro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro	000	000
Toro	I	Guillermo Del Toro	Guillermo_del_Toro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro	000	000
’s
Mimic	B	Mimic	Mimic_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimic_(film)	000	000
in
regards
to
the
central
creature
(
although
the
thing
is

never
fully
revealed
)
.

Of
course
,
tonally
,
the
movie
has
more
in
common
with

Del	B	Del Toro	Guillermo_del_Toro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro	000	000
Toro	I	Del Toro	Guillermo_del_Toro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro	000	000
’s
Cronos	B	Cronos	Cronos_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronos_(film)	000	000
.

Truth
is
,
if

you
’re
a
gorehound
,
you
’re
going
to
be
left
wanting
.

But
I
hope
most
who
read

this
,
while
maybe
aficionados
of
splatter
can
appreciate
a
great
story
,
well

told
,
despite
the
lack
of
the
red
stuff
.

Use
of
Audio

The
audio
levels
were
clear
and
consistent
throughout
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
.

Dialogue
was
never
muddy
and

all
Foley	B	Foley	Foley_(filmmaking)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foley_(filmmaking)	000	000
and
sound
effects
were
so
well
integrated
into
the
overall
sound

design
as
to
pass
unnoticed
(
as
it
should
be
)
.

The
musical
score
by
Ryan
David

Leack
was
subtle

and
effective
at
setting
the
tone
;
however
,
it
was
a
little
overused
for
my

tastes
.

There
were
several
scenes
where
the
music
was
meant
to
heighten
the

tension
,
but
the
actors
are
so
good
,
I
think
they
could
have
carried
the
scene

without
assistance
.

For
example
,
take
the
scene
between
Tricia
and
Detective

Mallory
in
the
car
.

He
’s
trying
to
convince
her
of
his
commitment
and
the
music

felt
heavy
handed
,
trying
too
hard
to
drive
home
the
emotional
importance
of

the
scene
.

That
being
said
,
I
can
definitely
see
how
the
music
was
used
to

bridge
the
scene
in
the
car
with
the
suspenseful
scene
it
was
juxtaposed
with
,

so
file
this
criticism
under
“
personal
preferences
”
.

And
when
the
police

search
for
answers
...

...
Callie
realizes
she
's

the

only
one
who
can
find
them
.

Use
of
Budget

The
budget
for
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
was
raised
through
crowd
funding
on
Kickstarter.com
,
a
fantastic
site
for
no
-

and
low-budget
filmmakers
to
raise
the
funds
needed
for
their
projects
.

The

original
budget
for
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
,
as

listed
on
Kickstarter	B	Kickstarter	Kickstarter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstarter	000	000
,
was
$
15,000
,
but
after
the
30
day
funding
drive
,
the

filmmakers
had
exceeded
that
amount
,
raising
over
$
25,000
!

I
highly
recommend

going
to
their
Kickstarter
page
(
http://thefivedrive.blogspot.com
)
,
reading

their
pitch
to
potential
donors
,
and
watching
all
the
promo
videos
they
put

together
.

The
videos
are
hilarious
(
nothing
is
more
appealing
than
truly

talented
people
who
can
make
fun
of
themselves
)
and
show
what
’s
possible
with
a

little
imagination
and
clever
selling
techniques
.

As
to
how
the
money
was
used
,
I
think
all
the
movie
’s
donors

got
their
money
’s
worth
.

Flanagan
and
his
DP	B	DP	Cinematographer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer	000	000
,

Cerveny
,
were
able
to
create
a
cinematic
look
using
primarily
available
light
.

And
while
the
Canon	B	Canon	Canon_Inc.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Inc.	000	000
is
able
to
capture
a
nice
depth
of
field
for
that
extra

“
movie
look
”
,
this
technique
was
n’t
overused
.

Along
with
the
Canon	B	Canon	Canon_Inc.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Inc.	000	000
,
money
was

spent
on
a
camera
package
that
included
a
35mm
Lens	B	Lens	Lens_(optics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens_(optics)	000	000
adapter
,
Steadicam	B	Steadicam	Steadicam	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steadicam	000	000
,

Glidecam
,
and
a
homemade
DSLR
rig
.

Additionally
,
a
third
of
the
budget
went
to
that
most

important
of
areas
--
sound
.

The
money
was
spent
on
both
production
and

post-production
sound
,
and
it
goes
without
saying
(
although
I
’m
about
to
)
that

a
film
can
only
benefit
from
great
sound
.

A
movie
with
subpar
images
(
see
Paranormal	B	Paranormal Activity	Paranormal_Activity	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal_Activity	000	000
Activity	I	Paranormal Activity	Paranormal_Activity	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal_Activity	000	000
or
The
Blair	B	Blair Witch Project	The_Blair_Witch_Project	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blair_Witch_Project	000	000
Witch	I	Blair Witch Project	The_Blair_Witch_Project	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blair_Witch_Project	000	000
Project	I	Blair Witch Project	The_Blair_Witch_Project	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blair_Witch_Project	000	000
)
,
but
excellent

sound
can
win
over
an
audience
.

However
,
if
the
reverse
is
true
,
and
the
movie

has
great
images
but
crappy
sound
,
you
’ll
lose
your
audience
every
time
.

Besides
camera
and
sound
,
the
budget
also
included
location

permits
and
another
important
category
craft
services
.

I
know
,
I
know
.

We
seem

to
drive
this
point
home
a
lot
here
at
MicroFilmmaker
,
but
that
’s
because
many

of
us
have
either
worked
on
a
set
where
the
only
available
grub
included
stale

bagels
and
questionable
cream
cheese
,
or
made
the
near-tragic
mistake
of
not

feeding
those
good
folks
who
so
generously
gave
of
their
free
time
to
help
us

on
our
projects
.

Lasting
Appeal

So
,
will
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
stand
the
test
of
time
?

Will
others
want
to
view
it
again
and
again
?

While

those
who
really
like
their
horror
dripping
with
goo
and
spew
will
be

disappointed
,
I
think
anyone
who
appreciates
subtle
,
creeping
,
quiet
,

character-driven
horror
will
be
very
satisfied
.

This
movie
is
n’t
just
for

horror
fans
,
mind
you
.

No
,
anyone
who
appreciates
great
storytelling
,
acting
,

and
that
good
‘
ol
indie-filmmaking
spirit
will
most
certainly
enjoy
it
too
.

Overall
Comment

Absentia
is
a

creepy
,
subtle
,
old-school
horror
movie
,
and
personally
,
I
loved
it
.

I
still

ca
n’t
get
over
how
good
all
the
actors
were
.

I
was
completely
drawn
into
the

story
;
not
just
the
first
time
I
watched
it
,
but
the
second
time
as
well
.

It
’s

a
slow
burn
,
for
sure
,
but
it
was
refreshing
to
see
a
filmmaker
show
the

maturity
,
confidence
,
and
restraint
that
’s
on
display
here
.

I
realize
much
of

the
“
restraint
”
was
due
to
budgetary
limitations
,
but
all
the
choices
felt
like
artistic
ones
.

While
I
have
yet
to
watch
Flanagan
’s
earlier
works
(
at
least

at
the
time
of
this
writing
)
,
Absentia	B	Absentia	Absentia_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentia_(film)	000	000
makes
me
eager
to
check
them
out
.

All
involved
deserve
high
praise
for
their

contributions
to
such
a
fine
example
of
micro-filmmaking
excellence
!

If
your

answer
"
is
an
image
or
photo
,
this
will
be
the
title
.

From
Wikipedia
:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source

-------------------------------

Open
source
describes
practices
in
production
and
development
that
promote
access
to
the
end
product
's
sources
.

Some
consider
it
as
a
philosophy
,
and
others
consider
it
as
a
pragmatic
methodology
.

Before
open
source
became
widely
adopted
,
developers
and
producers
used
a
variety
of
phrases
to
describe
the
concept
;
the
term
open
source
gained
popularity
with
the
rise
of
the
Internet
and
its
enabling
of
diverse
production
models
,
communication
paths
,
and
interactive
communities
.

Subsequently
,
open
source
software
became
the
most
prominent
face
of
open
source
.

The
open
source
model
can
allow
for
the
concurrent
use
of
different
agendas
and
approaches
in
production
,
in
contrast
with
more
centralized
models
of
development
such
as
those
typically
used
in
commercial
software
companies
.

-------------------------------

What
is
the
absolute
best
that
the
open
source
model
has
to
offer
?

The
term
is
usually
applied
to
software
specifically
,
but
I
'd
like
to
use
it
here
to
refer
to
any
community
developed
project
whose
collaborative
efforts
are
freely
available
to
all
to
use
and/or
modify
in
any
not-for-profit
manner
;
This
could
include
content
,
health
,
politics
,
religion
,
media
,
etc.

Ubuntu	B	Ubuntu	Ubuntu_(operating_system)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)	000	000
are
extremely
close

It

like
having

of
the
best
.

Wikipedia	B	Wikipedia	Wikipedia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia	000	000
for

The
list
is
a
work
in
progress
,
and
is
becoming
more
useful
and
accurate
as
people
continue
to
add
and
vote
on
their
favorites
;
If
something
does
n't
look
right
,
help
us
improve
the
list
by
contributing
new
answers
,
votes
,
and

Ubuntu
,
Debian
,
Wikipedia
,
and
Firefox
.

Those
three
are
tied
in
my
mind
for
their
outstanding
innovation
,
contribution
to
the
state
of
the
global
community
as
a
whole
,
and
the
fostering
of
access
,
knowledge
,
and
excellence
.

I
use
Ubuntu
and
Debian
exclusively
.

Really
the
first
would
be
LINUX
because
if
we
count
the
votes
of
linux
,
ubuntu
linux
and
debian
they
have
more
votes
than
firefox

Realmente
debiera
ser
primero
linux
porque
sumando
los
votos
de
linux
,
ubuntu
linux
y
debian
suman
mas
que
firefox

I
'm
surprised
that
the
GPL	B	GPL	GNU_General_Public_License	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License	000	000
still
has
n't
made
it
to
the
front
page
yet
;
come
on
people
!

@hajush
:
I
wholeheartedly
agree
;
it
's
fun
to
come
back
to
and
check
up
on
.

I
've
found
out
about
a
bunch
of
cool
projects
that
i
would
n't
have
otherwise

@k40s

Well
...
.

Technically
Linux	B	Linux	Linux	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux	000	000
is
solely
the
kernel
itself
,
a
project
in
it
's
own
right
.

When
people
usually
talk
about
GNU	B	GNU	Linux	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux	000	000
/
Linux	B	Linux	Linux	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux	000	000
as
an
OS	B	OS	Operating_system	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system	000	000
,
however
,
it
's
no
longer
a
single
project
.

I
consider
the
answer
for
Debian	B	Debian	Debian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian	000	000
as
a
project
which
utilizes
the
Linux	B	Linux kernel	Linux_kernel	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel	000	000
kernel	I	Linux kernel	Linux_kernel	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel	000	000
(
or
the
HURD	B	HURD	GNU_Hurd	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd	000	000
,
the
BSD	B	BSD	BSD_licenses	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses	000	000
kernel
,
etc.
)
,
and
then
Linux	B	Linux	Linux	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux	000	000
as
a
project
in
it
's
own
right
which
is
*
just
*
the
kernel
development
team
.

I
love
this
list
,
I
'm
going
to
add
some
more
to
it
as
I
find
em
.

I
ca
n't
believe
Paint.NET
was
n't
on
there
,
it
's
a
pretty
impressive
alternative
to
GIMP
.

Ever
since
I
went
to
Paint.NET
I
never
looked
back
at
GIMP
again
.

.

@davidthedrake

you
are
,
dave
,
but
a
giving
an
answer
like
"
del.icio.us
"
to
the
question
"
Best
Open
Source
Project
?
"

is
like
answering
the
question
"
Best
Restaurant
in

?
"

with

*
shrug

Mark
the
answer
as
irrelevant
then
.

With
enough
votes
,
it
'll
get
hidden
from

.

The
tools
are
there
,
just
got
ta
use
them

Well
,
the
description
states
that
it
does
n't
have
to
be
specifically
GPL	B	GPL	GNU_General_Public_License	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License	000	000
'd
software
,
but
simply
any
project
that
uses
the
"
open
source
model
"
i.e.
collaborative
,
open
information
sharing
.

I
would
say
that
del.icio.us
or
grupthink
fit
this
description
.

'S
DAY

MY
eyes
are
void
with
vision
;
I
sing
but
I

can
not
speak
;

I
hide
in
the
vaporous
caverns
like
a

creature
wild
and
weak

But
for
ever
my
harps
are
tuned
and
for
ever
my

songs
are
sung
,

And
I
answer
my
tyrants
ever
in
an
unknown

tongue
.

When
the
blue
men
broke
in
the
battle
with
the

Roman
or
the
Dane
,

The
cracks
of
my
ghastly
uplands
they
gathered

like
ghosts
again
.

Some
say
I
am
still
a
Druid
,
some
say
my
spirit

shows

Catholic
,
Puritan
,
Pagan
;
but
no
man
knows
.

Mother
of
God
's
good
witches
,
of
all
white

Whatever
else
I
am
seeking
,
I
seek
for
thee
.

at

it
is
a
better

to
be
a

A
MAN
may
easily
be
forgiven
for
not
doing
this

or
that
incidental
act
of
charity
,
especially

when
the
question
is
as
genuinely
difficult

and
dubious
as
is
the
case
of
mendicity
.

But
there

is
something
quite
pestilently
Pecksniffian	B	Pecksniffian	Self-righteousness	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-righteousness	000	000
about

shrinking
from
a
hard
task
on
the
plea
that
it
is
not

hard
enough
.

If
a
man
will
really
try
talking
to
the

ten
beggars
who
come
to
his
door
he
will
soon
find

out
whether
it
is
really
so
much
easier
than
the

labour
of
writing
a
cheque
for
a
hospital

MARCH

BUT
the
man
we
see
every
day
--
the
worker
in

Mr.
Gradgrind
's
factory
,
the
little
clerk
in

Mr.
Gradgrind
's
office
--
he
is
too
mentally

worried
to
believe
in
freedom
.

He
is
kept
quiet
with

revolutionary
literature
.

He
is
calmed
and
kept
in

his
place
by
a
constant
succession
of
wild
philosophies
.

He
is
a
Marxian
one
day
,
a
Nietzscheite

the
next
day
,
a
Superman	B	Superman	Superman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman	000	000
(
probably
)
the
next

day
,
and
a
slave
every
day
.

The
only
thing
that

remains
after
all
the
philosophies
is
the
factory
.

The
only
man
who
gains
by
all
the
philosophies
is

Gradgrind
.

It
would
be
worth
his
while
to
keep
his

commercial
helotry
supplied
with
sceptical
literature
.

And
now
I
come
to
think
of
it
,
of
course
,
Gradgrind

is
famous
for
giving
libraries
.

He
shows
his
sense
:

all
modern
books
are
on
his
side
.

As
long
as
the

vision
of
heaven
is
always
changing
,
the
vision
of

earth
will
be
exactly
the
same
.

No
ideal
will

remain
long
enough
to
be
realized
,
or
even
partly

realized
.

The
modern
young
man
will
never
change

his
environment
,
for
he
will
always
change
his

mind

IN

roared

it

stated
that

no

Humility
is

the
luxurious
art
of
reducing
ourselves
to
a

not

to
a
small

to
a
thing

THUS

believes
strongly
in

frenzy
of
those
who
killed

themselves
to
find
the

of

But

which
is
true
both
of

I

merely
that

the

about
the

MARCH

IN
one
of
his
least
convincing
phrases
,
Nietzsche	B	Nietzsche	Friedrich_Nietzsche	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche	000	000

had
said
that
just
as
the
ape
ultimately
produced

the
man
,
so
should
we
ultimately
produce

something
higher
than
the
man
.

The
immediate

answer
,
of
course
,
is
sufficiently
obvious
:
the
ape

did
not
worry
about
the
man
,
so
why
should
we

worry
about
the
superman
?

If
the
superman
will

come
by
natural
selection
,
may
we
not
leave
it
to

natural
selection
?

If
the
superman
will
come
by

human
selection
,
what
sort
of
superman
are
we
to

select
?

If
he
is
simply
to
be
more
just
,
more
brave
,

or
more
merciful
,
then
Zarathustra	B	Zarathustra	Zoroaster	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster	000	000
sinks
into
a

Sunday-school
teacher
;
the
only
way
we
can
work

for
it
is
to
be
more
just
,
more
brave
,
and
more

merciful
--
sensible
advice
,
but
hardly
startling
.

If
he
is
to
be
anything
else
than
this
,
why
should

we
desire
him
,
or
what
else
are
we
to
desire
?

These
questions
have
been
many
times
asked
of

none
of

have

even
attempted
to
answer
them

A
MAN
can
be
a
Christian
to
the
end
of
the

world
,
for
the
simple
reason
that
a
man

could
have
been
an
Atheist
from
the
beginning

of
it
.

The
materialism
of
things
is
on
the
face

of
things
:
it
does
not
require
any
science
to
find
it

out
.

A
man
who
has
lived
and
loved
falls
down

dead
and
the
worms
eat
him
.

That
is
Materialism	B	Materialism	Materialism	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism	000	000

if

That
is

if
you

If
mankind

has
believed
in
spite
of
that
,
it
can
believe
in

spite
of
anything
.

But
why
our
human
lot
is
made

any
more
hopeless
because
we
know
the
names
of

the
worms
who
eat
him
,
or
the
names
of
all
the

parts
of
him
that
they
eat
,
is
to
a
thoughtful
mind

somewhat
difficult
to
discover

MARCH

WE
should
probably
come
considerably
nearer
to

the
true
conception
of
things
if
we
treated
all

grown-up
persons
,
of
all
titles
and
types
,
with

precisely
that
dark
affection
and
dazed
respect
with

which
we
treat
the
infantile
limitations
.

A
child

has
no
difficulty
in
achieving
the
miracle
of
speech
,

consequently
we
find
his
blunders
almost
as
marvellous

as
his
accuracy
.

If
we
only
adopted
the
same

attitude
towards
Premiers	B	Premiers	Premier	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier	000	000
and
Chancellors
of
the

Exchequer	B	Exchequer	Exchequer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchequer	000	000
,
if
we
genially
encouraged
their
stammering

and
delightful
attempts

human
speech

we
should
be
in
a

more
wise

WE
men
and
women
are
all
in
the
same
boat
,

upon
a
stormy
sea
.

We
owe
to
each
other

a
terrible
and
tragic
loyalty
.

If
we
catch

sharks
for
food
,
let
them
be
killed
most
mercifully

let
anyone
who
likes
love
the
sharks
,
and
pet
the

sharks
,
and
tie
ribbons
round
their
necks
and
give

them
sugar
and
teach
them
to
dance
.

But
if
once
a

man
suggests
that
a
shark
is
to
be
valued
against
a

sailor
,
or
that
the
poor
shark
might
be
permitted

to
bite
off
a
nigger
's
leg
occasionally
,
then
I
would

court-martial
the
man
--
he
is
a
traitor
to
the
ship

I
HAVE
no
sympathy
with
international
aggression

when
it
is
taken
seriously
,
but
I
have
a

certain
dark
and
wild
sympathy
with
it
when

it
is
quite
absurd
.

Raids
are
all
wrong
as
practical

politics
,
but
they
are
human
and
imaginable
as

practical
jokes
.

In
fact
,
almost
any
act
of
ragging

or
violence
can
be
forgiven
on
this
strict
condition
--

that
it
is
of
no
use
at
all
to
anybody
.

If
the
aggression

gets
anything
out
of
it
,
then
it
is
quite
unpardonable
.

It
is
damned
by
the
least
hint
of
utility
or
profit
.

A
man
of
spirit
and
breeding
may
brawl
,
but
he
does

not
steal
.

A
gentleman
knocks
off
his

I

,
object

to
their
children
seeing

company

being
taught
by
a

Peggotty

But
surely
it
is
more
important
to

equality
than
in

And
a

once

had
to

will
respect
the

The
true
way
to

is
not

THERE
is
no
clearer
sign
of
the
absence
of

originality
among
modern
poets
than
their

disposition
to
find
new
topics
.

Really

original
poets
write
poems
about
the
spring
.

They

are
always
fresh
,
just
as
the
spring
is
always
fresh
.

Men
wholly
without
originality
write
poems
about

torture
,
or
new
religions
,
or
some
perversion
of

obscenity
,
hoping
that
the
mere
sting
of
the
subject

may
speak
for
them
.

But
we
do
not
sufficiently

realize
that
what
is
true
of
the
classic
ode
is
also

true
of
the
classic
joke
.

A
true
poet
writes
about

the
spring
being
beautiful
because
(
after
a
thousand

springs
)
the
spring
really
is
beautiful
.

In
the
same

way
the
true
humorist
writes
about
a
man
sitting

down
on
his
hat
because
the
act
of
sitting
down
on

one
's
own
hat
(
however
often
and
admirably

performed
)
really
is
extremely
funny
.

We
must
not

dismiss
a
new
poet
because
his
poem
is
called
'
To

a
Skylark
'
;
nor
must
we
dismiss
a
humorist

because
his
new
farce
is
called
'
My
Mother-in-Law
.
'

He
may
really
have
splendid
and
inspiring
things

to
say
upon
an
eternal
problem
.

The
whole

question
is
whether
he

SOCIAL
reformers
have
fired
a
hundred
shots

against
the
public-house
,
but
never
one

against
its
really
shameful
character
.

The

sign
of
decay
is
not
in
the
public-house
,
but
in

the
private
bar
;
or
rather
the
row
of
five
or
six

private
bars
,
into
each
of
which
a
respectable

dipsomaniac
can
go
in
solitude
,
and
by
indulging
his

own
half-witted
sin
violates
his
own
half-witted

morality
.

Nearly
all
these
places
are
equipped

with
an
atrocious
apparatus
of
ground-glass

windows
which
can
be
so
closed
that
they
practically

conceal
the
face
of
the
buyer
from
the
seller
.

Words
can
not
express
the
abysses
of
human

infamy
and
hateful
shame
expressed
by
that

elaborate
piece
of
furniture
.

Whenever
I
go
into

a
public-house
,
which
happens
fairly
often
,
I

always
carefully
open
all
these
apertures
and
then

leave
the
place
in
every
way
refreshed

IT
is
one
of
the
mean
and
morbid
modern
lies

that
physical
courage
is
connected
with

cruelty
.

The
Tolstoian
and
Kiplingite
are

nowhere
more
at
one
than
in
maintaining
this
.

They
have
,
I
believe
,
some
small
sectarian
quarrel

with
each
other
:
the
one
saying
that
courage

must
be
abandoned
because
it
is
connected
with

cruelty
,
and
the
other
maintaining
that
cruelty

is
charming
because
it
is
a
part
of
courage
.

But

it
is
all
,
thank
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
,
a
lie
.

An
energy
and
boldness

of
body
may
make
a
man
stupid
or
reckless
or
dull

or
drunk
or
hungry
,
but
it
does
not
make
him

spiteful

CRUELTY	B	CRUELTY	Cruelty	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty	000	000
to
animals
is
cruelty
and
a
vile

thing
;
but
cruelty
to
a
man
is
not
cruelty
;

it
is
treason
.

Tyranny
over
a
man
is
not

tyranny
:
it
is
rebellion
,
for
man
is
royal
.

Now
,

the
practical
weakness
of
the
vast
mass
of
modern

pity
for
the
poor
and
the
oppressed
is
precisely

that
it
is
merely
pity
;
the
pity
is
pitiful
,
but
not

respectful
.

Men
feel
that
the
cruelty
to
the
poor

is
a
kind
of
cruelty
to
animals
.

They
never
feel

that
it
is
injustice
to
equals
;
nay
,
it
is
treachery

to
comrades
.

This
dark
,
scientific
pity
,
this

brutal
pity
,
has
an
elemental
sincerity
of
its
own
,

but
it
is
entirely
useless
for
all
ends
of
social
reform
.

Democracy
swept
Europe	B	Europe	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
with
the
sabre
when
it

was
founded
upon
the
Rights
of
Man
.

It
has
done

literally
nothing
at
all
since
it
has
been
founded

only
upon
the
wrongs
of
man
.

Or
,
more
strictly

speaking
,
its
recent
failure
has
been
due
to
its

not
admitting
the
existence
of
any
rights
or
wrongs
,

or
indeed
of
any
humanity
.

Evolution	B	Evolution	Evolution	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution	000	000

existence
of
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
:
what
it
does
deny

is
the
existence
of
man
.

And
all
the
despair

about
the
poor
,
and
the
cold
and
repugnant
pity

for
them
,
has
been
largely
due
to
the
vague
sense

that
they
have
literally
relapsed
into
the
state

of
the
lower
animals

Back
in
the
good
old
days
when
Ozzie	B	Ozzie	Ozzie_Nelson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzie_Nelson	000	000
and
Harriet	B	Harriet Nelson	Harriet_Nelson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Nelson	000	000
Nelson	I	Harriet Nelson	Harriet_Nelson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Nelson	000	000
were
raising
a
couple
of
lads
on
TV
,
men
worked
45
years
for
the
same
company
and
retired
on
a
pension
while
their
dutiful
wives
stayed
at
home
and
kept
the
household
running
smoothly
.

These
days
both
husbands
and
wives
can
expect
to
bounce
from
job
to
job
and
even
career
to
career
several
times
before
they
'll
have
enough
free
time
to
watch
old
Ozzie	B	Ozzie	Ozzie_Nelson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzie_Nelson	000	000
and
Harriet	B	Harriet	Harriet_Nelson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Nelson	000	000
reruns
.

I
have
a
friend
named
Lynn
,
age
63
,
who
was
a
systems
engineer
at
IBM	B	IBM	IBM	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM	000	000
and
later
a
senior
systems
analyst
for
Lockheed	B	Lockheed	Lockheed_Corporation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation	000	000
in
Southern	B	Southern California	Southern_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California	000	000
California	I	Southern California	Southern_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California	000	000
.

After
over
20
years
in
information
technology
,
she
spent
a
decade
overseas
with
her
engineer
husband
as
a
housewife
.

When
she
tried
to
get
back
into
the
computer
job
market
upon
returning
to
the
states
,
she
was
shut
out
.

So
she
started
a
new
life
in
her
mid
50s
by
attending
nursing
school
and
becoming
a
nurse
.

I
have
a
friend
named
Campbell	B	Campbell	Campbell_Soup_Company	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Soup_Company	000	000
,
age
59
,
who
was
a
marketing
executive
for
a
major
grocery
store
chain
in
Charlotte	B	Charlotte	Charlotte,_North_Carolina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina	000	000
,
NC	B	NC	North_Carolina	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina	000	000
.

He
had
started
as
a
bag
boy
when
he
was
a
freshman
in
college
and
eventually
worked
his
way
up
to
the
executive
suite
.

When
the
company
was
taken
over
by
another
food
chain
a
few
years
ago
,
he
and
other
executives
were
given
a
pat
on
the
back
and
escorted
out
the
building
.

He
has
yet
to
find
another
job
.

In
today
's
workplace
environment
,
you
need
to
be
flexible
.

Just
when
you
reach
the
pinnacle
of
your
profession
,
your
profession
may
disappear
.

At
that
point
,
you
're
probably
overqualified
to
even
get
another
job
.

I
have
a
friend
named
Jane
,
age
43
,
who
is
a
Microsoft
Certified
Engineer
in
Memphis	B	Memphis	Memphis,_Tennessee	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee	000	000
.

When
times
got
tough
for
her
,
she
became
a
certified
massage
therapist
.

Now
she
has
a
full
list
of
regular
clients
that
keeps
her
busy
.

She
also
designs
websites
.

Her
enterprising
nature
has
allowed
her
to
maintain
a
100-acre
horse
ranch
.

I
have
a
friend
named
Dean	B	Dean	Dean_(education)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education)	000	000
,
age
68
,
who
once
worked
for
others
as
a
metal
polisher
.

Being
the
sort
of
rebellious
,
vocal
employee
who
always
found
better
ways
of
doing
things
,
he
often
found
himself
at
odds
with
management
.

So
he
set
up
shop
in
his
basement
in
Minneapolis	B	Minneapolis	Minneapolis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis	000	000
a
couple
of
decades
ago
and
now
fashions
antique
car
parts
for
rich
collectors
and
distributors
.

He
has
so
much
demand
for
his
unique
skill
that
he
turns
projects
down
.

I
have
a
friend
named
Patrick
,
age
62
,
who
once
owned
a
pizza
joint
in
Phoenix	B	Phoenix	Phoenix,_Arizona	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona	000	000
.

When
business
turned
slow
a
decade
ago
,
he
studied
and
became
a
stockbroker
,
then
found
a
position
with
a
major
brokerage
house
.

His
wife
who
had
also
worked
in
the
pizza
joint
became
a
successful
real
estate
agent
.

I
have
a
friend
named
Stan
,
age
49
,
who
was
once
a
contract
computer
programmer
in
Chicago	B	Chicago	Chicago	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago	000	000
.

He
eventually
tired
of
the
stress
of
meeting
project
goals
and
the
uncertainty
of
finding
another
contract
,
so
he
worked
nights
as
a
janitor
in
large
office
buildings
.

Soon
he
hired
others
to
do
the
janitorial
work
and
continually
expanded
to
more
and
more
buildings
.

Today
he
has
dozens
of
employees
and
spends
much
of
his
time
in
the
Bahamas	B	Bahamas	The_Bahamas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas	000	000
.

There
is
a
guy
in
Wyoming	B	Wyoming	Wyoming	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming	000	000
named
Stanford
Addison
.

At
age
20
,
his
truck
went
out
of
control
as
he
tried
to
avoid
hitting
a
herd
of
horses
.

After
two
long
years
of
hospitalization
with
a
spinal
cord
injury
,
he
became
a
quadriplegic
confined
to
a
wheelchair
for
the
rest
of
his
life

Today
,
some
30
years
later
,
Addison
calls
himself
a
"
horse
counselor
"
as
he
works
with
wild
mustangs
and
horses
with
behavioral
problems
.

Getting
in
the
training
pen
with
a
wild
horse
"
puts
you
right
in
there
where
you
have
to
use
all
the
gifts
that
the
creator
blessed
you
with
,
"
Addison
explains
.

I
met
a
woman
named
Frankie
,
age
53
,
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
we
have
done
a
couple
of
writing
projects
together
.

A
few
years
prior
to
that
,
she
was
in
a
serious
motorcycle
accident
and
spent
many
,
many
months
in
a
hospital
rehabilitating
her
broken
body
just
to
be
able
to
walk
once
again
.

She
had
flourished
in
the
corporate
world
as
an
event
promoter
,
but
changed
directions
after
the
accident
.

Today
,
the
unstoppable
Frankie
Picasso
is
a
radio-show
host
,
author
,
motivational
speaker
,
and
professional
Certified

Coach
Trainer
.

Some
people
are
helpless
without
a
manager
.

Some
people
are
hopeless
unless
they
become
the
manager
.

Some
people
want
the
security
of
a
large
organization
.

Some
people
want
to
be
self-employed
.

Some
people
want
to
work
indoors
.

Some
people
want
to
work
outdoors
.

And
some
people
do
n't
want
to
work
at
all
.

But
whatever
direction
you
choose
,
you
need
to
be
prepared
to
scramble
for
a
cash
flow
simply
to
exist
in
this
material
world
.

Food
,
clothing
and
shelter
are
necessary
items
for
self-preservation
.

And
if
you
are
foolish
enough
to
yearn
for
luxury
and
bling-bling
,
you
need
to
scramble
that
much
harder
.

I
spent
decades
as
a
contract
computer
programmer
myself
until
my
specialty
language
died
.

But
I
'm
not
too
eager
to
clean
buildings
so
I
wrote
some
novels
,
a
highly
unprofitable
endeavor
so
far
.

I
also
wrote
a
weekly
newspaper
column
and
taught
college
computer
courses
for
many
years
.

I
finally
retired
last
year
.

In
a
world
of
rapidly
advancing
technology
and
global
financial
instability
,
the
job
market
is
changing
faster
than
a
bullet
train
on
steroids
.

You
need
to
acquire
a
variety
of
skills
and
be
prepared
to
adapt
to
the
changing
times
.

Life
is
simple
--
choose
a
lifestyle
that
makes
you
happy
,
figure
out
a
way
to
make
it
work
and
do
it
.

The
world
does
n't
owe
you
a
job
.

You
owe
it
to
yourself
to
find
the
correct
path
.

Quote
for
the
Day
--
"
If
you
are
going
to
have
dreams
,
make
them
big
dreams
.

It
takes
the
same
amount
of
effort
and
energy
for
conversion
.

Glorified
scrimmage
?

You
bet
.

An
opportunity
for
little-used
walk-ons
to
get
their
15
seconds
of
of
fame
in
a
relatively-full
Memorial	B	Memorial Stadium	Memorial_Stadium,_Lincoln	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Stadium,_Lincoln	000	000
Stadium	I	Memorial Stadium	Memorial_Stadium,_Lincoln	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Stadium,_Lincoln	000	000
?

That
,
too
.

It
wo
n't
be
flashy
.

It
wo
n't
be
revealing
schematically
.

But
that
does
n't
mean
Nebraska	B	Nebraska	Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football	000	000
's
Red/White
Spring
Game
is
bereft
of
stories
.

Coaches
absolutely
want
to
accomplish
something
in
the
three
hours
they
're
prowling
around
Tom
Osborne
Field
looking
for
players
to
praise
and
critique
.

Five
things
to
watch
for
as
Huskers
put
on
their
spring
show
and
prepare
for
their
inaugural
Big
Ten
season
:

Trench
skirmishes
:
Defensive
coordinator
Carl	B	Carl Pelini	Carl_Pelini	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Pelini	000	000
Pelini	I	Carl Pelini	Carl_Pelini	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Pelini	000	000
and
defensive
line
coach
John	B	John Papuchis	John_Papuchis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Papuchis	000	000
Papuchis	I	John Papuchis	John_Papuchis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Papuchis	000	000
have
n't
sweated
too
much
the
absence
of
end
Cameron
Meredith
and
tackle
Jared	B	Jared Crick	Jared_Crick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Crick	000	000
Crick	I	Jared Crick	Jared_Crick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Crick	000	000
for
spring
camp
.

Why
?

They
like
the
talent
and
depth
behind
those
two
.

Along
with
returning
starter
Baker
Steinkuhler
,
Thad
Randle
's
made
a
move
to
the
No.
1s
this
spring
.

Eric
Martin
,
by
all
reports
,
is
wreaking
havoc
as
an
undersized
defensive
end
.

Chase
Rome
and
Jay
Guy
have
flashed
some
potential
to
play
next
year
at
tackle
.

Terrence
Moore
is
working
his
way
back
into
shape
after
he
suffered
an
injury
in
the
Holiday	B	Holiday Bowl	Holiday_Bowl	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Bowl	000	000
Bowl	I	Holiday Bowl	Holiday_Bowl	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_Bowl	000	000
,
but
he
'd
start
at
many
Big	B	Big Ten	Big_Ten_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference	000	000
Ten	I	Big Ten	Big_Ten_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference	000	000
programs
.

True
freshman
Kevin	B	Kevin Williams	Kevin_Williams_(defensive_tackle)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Williams_(defensive_tackle)	000	000
Williams	I	Kevin Williams	Kevin_Williams_(defensive_tackle)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Williams_(defensive_tackle)	000	000
missed
a
week
of
spring
camp
with
a
foot
injury
,
but
he
returned
Wednesday
.

Could
he
get
a
play
or
two
Saturday
?

The
offensive
line
,
meanwhile
,
is
in
transition
.

Position
coaches
Barney	B	Barney Cotton	Barney_Cotton	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Cotton	000	000
Cotton	I	Barney Cotton	Barney_Cotton	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Cotton	000	000
and
John	B	John Garrison	John_Garrison_(ice_hockey)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Garrison_(ice_hockey)	000	000
Garrison	I	John Garrison	John_Garrison_(ice_hockey)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Garrison_(ice_hockey)	000	000
emphasized
physicality
and
effort
with
a
young
,
unproven
bunch
whose
forebearers
were
manhandled
at
the
end
of
2010
.

Starting
tackle
Jeremiah
Sirles
missed
spring
,
too
--
but
his
loss
is
felt
more
acutely
than
Meredith
and
Crick	B	Crick	Jared_Crick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Crick	000	000
's
absence
.

Young
pups

Tyler
Moore
(
a
true
freshman
)
and
Jake
Cotton
(
redshirt
freshman
)
made
strong
moves
this
spring
up
the
depth
chart
.

So
what
happens
when
factions
of
these
units
match
up
against
each
other
?

The
defensive
line
should
have
the
edge
.

But
watch
guards
Andrew
Rodriguez
and
Brent
Qvale
closely
.

They
're
supposed
to
be
the
starters
next
year
.

Can
they
hold
their
own
against
guys
like
Randle
,
Moore
and
Steinkuhler
?

Also
:
Can
the
young
pups

Tempo	B	Tempo	Tempo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo	000	000
:
Nebraska	B	Nebraska	Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football	000	000
wo
n't
reveal
many
of
its
offensive
wrinkles
--
or
,
as
wide
receiver
Brandon
Kinnie
called
it
,
“
hoo
ha
”
-

that
it
installed
over
the
last
week
.

No
stunner
.

But
there
's
a
good
chance
you
'll
see
the
Huskers	B	Huskers	Nebraska_Cornhuskers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Cornhuskers	000	000
'
new
no-huddle
tempo
.

It
's
been
around
long
enough
in
college
football
not
to
be
considered
secret
or
revolutionary
.

NU	B	NU	Nu_(mythology)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_(mythology)	000	000
would
n't
want
to
waste
the
opportunity
,
either
,
to
see
how
its
quarterbacks
handle
play
calls
and
game
management
in
front
of
a
large
crowd
.

So
what
to
watch
?

First
,
see
how
the
offensive
line
is
handling
the
speed
of
the
game
.

They
have
to
be
in
terrific
shape
for
a
no-huddle
to
be
truly
effective
.

Second
,
watch
for
which
quarterback
best
embodies
the
“
quick
,
but
not
in
a
hurry
”
manner
that
you
need
to
run
the
no-huddle
effectively
.

The
worst
thing
a
quarterback
can
do
is
waste
a
down
because
he
rushed
his
pre-snap
setup
and
reads
.

Third
,
look
at
the
passes
thrown
out
of
this
tempo
.

While
they
'll
be
vanilla
in
design
,
fans
should
still
get
a
decent
flavor
for
how
a
rhythm-based
passing
game
relies
on
timing
and
placement
of
throws
.

Playmakers
:
Reporters
and
fans
have
heard
nothing
but
praise
for
receivers
Jamal
Turner
,
Kenny
Bell
and
Stanley
Jean-Baptiste
and
their
playmaking
skills
.

Last
year
,
NU	B	NU	Nu_(mythology)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_(mythology)	000	000
lacked
a
“
something
out
of
nothing
”
threat
at
wide
receiver
,
a
guy
who
could
turn
a
two-yard
swing
pass
into
a
25-yard
gain
.

Outside
of
a
few
big
plays
to
tight
end
Kyler
Reed
,
Nebraska	B	Nebraska	Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football	000	000
also
lacked
a
consistent
deep
threat
.

Senior
Brandon
Kinnie
is
a
solid
anchor
on
the
field
side
,
a
tough-minded
,
possession
receiver
who
should
be
the
go-to
guy
near
the
goal
line
.

But
when
defenses
roll
a
two-man
“
bracket
”
coverage
his
way
,
or
force
his
routes
back
toward
traffic
--
as
Oklahoma	B	Oklahoma	Oklahoma_Sooners_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners_football	000	000
did
in
the
Big
12
Championship
--
somebody
on
the
other
side
has
to
make
the
defense
pay
.

And
Niles	B	Niles Paul	Niles_Paul	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niles_Paul	000	000
Paul	I	Niles Paul	Niles_Paul	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niles_Paul	000	000
is
n't
over
there
anymore
.

A
big
play
or
two
out
of
the
above
trio
would
be
a
confidence
boost
heading
into
the
summer
.

Carnes
vs.
Green
:
With
quarterback
Taylor	B	Taylor Martinez	Taylor_Martinez	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Martinez	000	000
Martinez	I	Taylor Martinez	Taylor_Martinez	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Martinez	000	000
getting
limited
action
in
the
Spring
Game
because
of
lingering
ankle
and
toe
injuries
--
those
need
to
heal
up
over
the
summer
,
as
reports
out
of
practice
suggested
Martinez	B	Martinez	Taylor_Martinez	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Martinez	000	000
still
was
n't
quite
“
right
”
-
and
Kody
Spano
out
too
,
Saturday
boils
down
to
an
intriguing
battle
between
junior
Cody
Green
and
redshirt
freshman
Brion
Carnes
.

Last
Saturday
,
Carnes
had
his
best
scrimmage
yet
,
while
Green
has
turned
some
heads
in
camp
with
improved
passing
mechanics
.

How
do
they
perform
with
a
crowd
watching
?

Green
had
a
perfunctory-at-best
Spring
Game
last
year
,
as
his
attempt
to
snatch
the
job
from
Zac	B	Zac Lee	Zac_Lee	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Lee	000	000
Lee	I	Zac Lee	Zac_Lee	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Lee	000	000
passed
by
the
boards
.

What
about
this
year
?

As
much
as
coaches
want
to
play
down
the
Spring
Game
,
Green
can
make
a
statement
with
a
strong
performance
.

Carnes
has
the
tools
--
he
just
needs
the
polish
.

Watch
his
passing
motion
for
efficiency
and
enjoy
his
playmaking
abilities
outside
of
the
pocket
.

Odds
are
he
does
one
thing
Saturday
that
neither
Green
or
Martinez	B	Martinez	Taylor_Martinez	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Martinez	000	000
do
n't
do
well
:
Throw
on
the
run
.

Hustle
and
Flow
:
More
than
ever
in
the
Bo	B	Bo Pelini	Bo_Pelini	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Pelini	000	000
Pelini	I	Bo Pelini	Bo_Pelini	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Pelini	000	000
era
,
Nebraska	B	Nebraska	Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Cornhuskers_football	000	000
's
defense
will
need
its
linebackers
to
do
many
of
things
linebackers
traditionally
do
.

Fit
the
interior
the
run
.

Man
up
against
a
lead
blocker
or
a
pulling
guard
.

Take
a
smart
drop
on
a
tight
end
bolting
up
the
seam
and
make
a
play
downfield
.

Although
the
Huskers	B	Huskers	Nebraska_Cornhuskers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Cornhuskers	000	000
have
generally
hung
their
hat
on
an
elite
front
four
and
even
more
dominant
secondary
,
Bo	B	Bo	Bo_Pelini	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Pelini	000	000
and
Carl	B	Carl	Carl_Pelini	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Pelini	000	000
's
defense
is
actually
designed
to
free
up
the
linebackers
--
that
is
,
LaVonte	B	LaVonte David	Lavonte_David	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavonte_David	000	000
David	I	LaVonte David	Lavonte_David	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavonte_David	000	000
,
Sean
Fisher
and
Will
Compton
--
to
make
most
of
the
plays
.

While
all
three
probably
wo
n't
play
together
Saturday
,
watch
for
their
chemistry
when
two
of
them
are
out
there
.

How
do
they
communicate
?

How
do
they
flow
to
the
ball

Another
enlightening
month
of
Leadership
Las	B	Las Vegas	Las_Vegas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas	000	000
Vegas	I	Las Vegas	Las_Vegas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas	000	000
has
opened
my
eyes
to
a
few
things
that
I
believe
everyone
in
the
Southern	B	Southern Nevada	Southern_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Nevada	000	000
Nevada	I	Southern Nevada	Southern_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Nevada	000	000
community
should
be
made
aware
of
.

Everyone
seems
to
have
an
opinion
on
education
.

However
,
few
people
have
the
opportunity
to
view
it
from
the
inside
out
.

That
is
exactly
what
Leadership
Las	B	Las Vegas	Las_Vegas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas	000	000
Vegas	I	Las Vegas	Las_Vegas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas	000	000
Class
of
2009
spent
the
month
of
January
doing
.

On
the
evening
news
we
hear
of
sub-standard
test
data
and
other
negative
outcomes
while
school
administrators
and
teachers
struggle
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
infamous
No	B	No Child Left Behind	No_Child_Left_Behind_Act	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act	000	000

Behind	I	No Child Left Behind	No_Child_Left_Behind_Act	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Child_Left_Behind_Act	000	000
legislation
.

Very
rarely
do
we
hear
of
all
the
excellent
programs
provided
by
the
Clark	B	Clark County School District	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000

(
CCSD	B	CCSD	Charleston_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston_County_School_District	000	000
)
.

Now
,
the
problems
are
compounded
by
current
financial
crisis
.

Now
,
more
than
ever
,
the
future
of
Nevada	B	Nevada	Southern_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Nevada	000	000
depend
on
public
support
.

Nevada	B	Nevada	Southern_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Nevada	000	000
State
Senator
Steven	B	Steven Horsford	Steven_Horsford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Horsford	000	000
Horsford	I	Steven Horsford	Steven_Horsford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Horsford	000	000
made
a
comment
during
a
Leadership
panel
that
suggested
funding
for
schools
was
“
equitably
divided
”
among
Nevada	B	Nevada	Southern_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Nevada	000	000
school
districts
.

However
,
Clark	B	Clark County School District	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000

receives
less
money
per
student
than
any
other
district
in
the
State
.

As
a
parent
of
3
school-aged
kids
,
I
believe
that
the
community
needs
to
demand
some
answers
from
their
local
representatives
in
the
State
legislature
.

I
am
not
seeing
the
equity
.

These
figures
are
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
.

District	I	Clark County School District	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
is
the
5th
largest
school
district
in
the
entire
nation
.

There
are
311,240
students
enrolled
in
347
Clark	B	Clark County	Clark_County,_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada	000	000
County	I	Clark County	Clark_County,_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada	000	000
public
schools
.

7
new
schools
and
4
replacement
schools
opened
in
August
of
2008
.

Currently
,
there
are
18
,
168
licensed
teachers
employed
by
CCSD	B	CCSD	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
--
1,640
hired
this
year
.

The
comparatively
slim
administration
consists
of
1,337
administrators
and
12,013
support
staff
.

There
are
a
total
of
38,611
CCSD	B	CCSD	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
employees
.

It
is
important
to
also
consider
what
the
student
population
looks
like
.

There
are
110
languages
spoken
by
students
in
Clark	B	Clark County	Clark_County,_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada	000	000
County	I	Clark County	Clark_County,_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada	000	000
schools
.

Some
of
these
languages
are
only
verbal
,
creating
some
additional
challenges
for
educators
.

In
a
an
average
classroom
of
33
students
,
7
of
them
are
learning
the
English	B	English language	English_language	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language	000	000
language	I	English language	English_language	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language	000	000
(
ELL	B	ELL	Ell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ell	000	000
)
,
13
are
living
at
or
below
poverty
,
4
of
them
have
learning
differences
requiring
an
Individualized	B	Individualized Education Program	Individualized_Education_Program	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualized_Education_Program	000	000

(
IEP	B	IEP	Individualized_Education_Program	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualized_Education_Program	000	000
)
and
2
of
them
have
been
identified
as
gifted
.

The
newer
‘
prototype
’
high
schools
are
built
to
accommodate
2,700
students
but
have
had
enrollment
as
high
as
3,956
in
recent
years
.

Even
in
these
conditions
,
teacher
salaries
start
at
$
35,083
per
year
.

It
is
important
to
note
that
these
educators
are
,
in
many
cases
,
top-notch
teachers
.

63
%
of
CCSD	B	CCSD	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
teachers
hold
a
graduate
degree
.

Certainly
,
it
is
the
desire
to
teach
rather
than
the
need
for
a
progressive
salary
that
motivates
these
individuals
to
show
up
at
work
each
day
.

Clark	B	Clark County	Clark_County,_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada	000	000
County	I	Clark County	Clark_County,_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada	000	000
has
a
96.4
%
attendance
rate
for
these
teachers
.

Clark
County
Schools
receives
a
meager
$
7,355
per
student
each
year
to
fund
the
education
of
students
through
high
school
.

The
national
,
per
student
average
is
$
8,380
.

Nevada	B	Nevada	Southern_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Nevada	000	000
spends
almost
3
times
this
amount
on
convicted
felons
in
the
prison
system
(
$
22,000
)
.

This
,
to
me
,
is
a
crime
in
itself
.

Are
you
calling
your
legislator
yet
?

Clark	B	Clark County School District	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000

District	I	Clark County School District	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
is
the
home
of
21
magnet
programs
for
students
with
vocational
interests
,
such
as
my
daughter
who
is
a
junior
at
SECTA
High
School
,
one
of
the
CCSD	B	CCSD	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
magnet
schools
.

These
magnet
programs
have
helped
keep
some
of
the
students
in
school
--
an
important
consideration
knowing
that
the
graduation
rate
for
the
class
of
2006
was
63.8
%
.

In
2007
,
only
3,639
graduating
students
had
plans
to
go
to
college
.

So
,
in
addition
to
buying
books
and
pencils
,
Clark	B	Clark County School District	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
County	I	Clark County School District	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
School	I	Clark County School District	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
District	I	Clark County School District	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
has
an
incredible
amount
to
accomplish
with
the
smallest
per
student
paycheck
in
the
state
.

Speaking
of
pencils
,
CCSD	B	CCSD	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
purchased
750,000
of
them
last
year
.

They
provided
students
a
ride
to
and
from
school
with
5,944
bus
routes
per
day
using
a
fleet
of
1,267
buses
.

With
budget
cuts
affecting
the
bottom
line
,
more
and
more
each
day
,
the
CCSD	B	CCSD	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
must
constantly
ponder
what
services
they
can
continue
to
provide
and
specifically
which
segments
of
the
student
population
will
lose
out
.

There
are
federal
mandates
that
stipulate
certain
things
,
like
special
education
.

This
leaves
‘
extra
’
services
especially
vulnerable
.

These
include
things
like
the
homework
hot
line
which
received
9,740
calls
last
year
alone
.

Or
,
should
safety
be
compromised
?

There
are
143
school
police
and
177
nurses
that
keep
our
children
and
public
property
safe
.

Bus
drivers
commute
20.9
miles
each
year
while
custodians
clean
34
million
square
feet
of
school
.

The
district
provides
free
or
reduced
lunch
to
127,557
students
every
day
.

This
accounts
for
a
substantial
amount
of
the
27,593,400
cartons
of
milk
that
were
served
to
CCSD	B	CCSD	Clark_County_School_District	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County_School_District	000	000
students
in
the
2007-2008
school
year
.

Yes
,
that
figure
is
27
million
.

Contrary
to
popular
belief
,
only
0.1
%
of
the
general
fund
comes
from
the
federal
government
.

35.5
%
comes
from
Sales	B	Sales Tax	Sales_tax	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax	000	000
Tax	I	Sales Tax	Sales_tax	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax	000	000
,
31.7
%
comes
from
State
Support
Tax
,
and
28.3
%
comes
from
Property	B	Property Tax	Property_tax	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax	000	000
Tax	I	Property Tax	Property_tax	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax	000	000
.

While
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
State
tax
base
needs
serious
help
,
it
is
only
partially
salient
.

Our
local
School	B	School District	School_district	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district	000	000
District	I	School District	School_district	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district	000	000
needs
a
way
to
generate
income
as
long
as
the
State	B	State of Nevada	Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada	000	000
of	I	State of Nevada	Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada	000	000
Nevada	I	State of Nevada	Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada	000	000
is
not
doing
its
part
.

Our
Governor
,
Jim	B	Jim Gibbons	Jim_Gibbons_(U.S._politician)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gibbons_(U.S._politician)	000	000
Gibbons	I	Jim Gibbons	Jim_Gibbons_(U.S._politician)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gibbons_(U.S._politician)	000	000
,
has
suggested
cutting
education
and
reducing
teacher
salaries
even
more
.

I
have
accepted
this
as
confirmation
that
he
has
completely
lost
his
mind
.

Or
,
maybe
he
just
does
not
understand
the
critical
role
of
education
in
society
.

I
hope
that
the
legislators
have
more
hope
for
the
State	B	State of Nevada	Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada	000	000
of	I	State of Nevada	Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada	000	000
Nevada	I	State of Nevada	Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada	000	000
than
our
Governor
.

Call
them
,
write
them
,
let
them
know
that
this
is
not
an
acceptable
option
for
the
future
of
our
children
!

And
,
while
you
are
at
it
,
stop
a
CCSD
employee
and
let
them
know
they
are
all
doing
a
great
job
!

As
a
retired
teacher
who
taught
30
years
in
California	B	California	California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California	000	000
and
5
years
in
a
Charter	B	Charter School	Charter_school	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school	000	000
School	I	Charter School	Charter_school	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school	000	000

County	I	Clark County	Clark_County,_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada	000	000
,
you
need
to
be
aware
that
sharing
the
negative
rather
than
the

positive
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
.

Unfortunately
negativity
brings
readership
or
viewers
.

It
is
beyond
my
understanding
how
,
in
a
society
which
is
is
supposed
to
provide
world
leadership
,
that
we
can
pay
millions
to
athletes
,
singers
,
and
actors
and
actresses
yet
we
pay
peon
wages
to
teachers
and
doctors
who
mold
our
children
to
be
our
new
leaders
.

We
have
a
totally
messed
up
value
system
.

Good
teachers
work
their
perverbial
butts
off
and
get
little
,
if
any
,
thanks
for
it
,
except
for
the
letter
or
phone
call
from
an
irate
parent
complaining
.

In
California	B	California	California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California	000	000
,
the
school
supplied
pencils
,
paper
,
glue
,
tissues
,
composition
books
,
materials
for
art
projects
,
poster
board
...
Here
the
families
supply
all
those
materials
...
THERE
SHOULD
BE
MONEY
TO
PAY
TEACHERS
A
REASONIBLE
SALARY
.

Want
to
know
why
Clark	B	Clark County	Clark_County,_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada	000	000
County	I	Clark County	Clark_County,_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada	000	000
ca
n’t
get
teachers
?

The
year
I
came
to
Clark	B	Clark County	Clark_County,_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada	000	000
County	I	Clark County	Clark_County,_Nevada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_Nevada	000	000
I
got
credit
for
4
or
my
35
years
on
the
payscale
.

If
we
are
to
get
and
keep
GOOD
teachers
,
they
need
to
be
paid
a
decent
salary
and
given
credit
for
all
their
hard
work
.

Teachers
just
do
n’t
teach
.

They
write
curriculum
,
design
special
programs
,
spend
hours
of
UNPAID
time
grading
papers
and
planning
their
next
day
,
week
,
month
and
so
much
more.So
wake

be

patient

outside
the
College

summer
of

renovation
and
construction
.

for
Weigel
Library
are
:
Monday

Friday
8
a.m.

p.m.
and

weekends
.

For
the
academic
year
beginning
Monday
,
August
22
,
Weigel
Library

They
represent
APDesign

in
many
ways

giving
tours
to
prospective
students
,
helping
with

.

The
mentor
program
began
as
a
grassroots
effort
.

Today
,
the
group
is

still
a
grassroots
organization
,
but
they
receive
logistical
support

from
the
Dean	B	Dean	Dean_(education)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(education)	000	000
’s
Office/Student
Services

Any
APDesign
ambassador

may
volunteer
to
be
a
mentor
.

This
program
has
helped
with
the

retention
of
our
students
by
easing
the
nervous
feelings
associated

with
the
first
day
of
classes
.

Mentors
are
asked
to
stay
in
contact

with
their
mentees
throughout
the

From
the
Provost
:
New
Faculty
Awards
Website

As
the
fall
2011
semester
is
just
around
the
corner
,
I
wanted
to
take

this
time
to
introduce
a
new
initiative
of
the
Office
of
the
Provost
.

One
of
the
metrics
of
our
vision
of
K-State
2025
concerns
the
number

of
faculty
members
who
receive
national
awards
.

In
the
past
years
,

K-State
has
had
very
few
faculty
members
receive
such
awards
.

Part
of

the
problem
is
that
very
few
faculty
members
have
been
nominated
or

have
applied
for
these
awards
.

We
believe
we
have
many
outstanding

scholars
at
K-State
,
and
such
awards
are
only
possible
if
we
nominate

them
.

My
office
has
put
together
a
website

--
http://www.k-state.edu/provost/resources/natlawards.htm —

that
lists
all
of
these
prestigious
national
awards
,
providing
a

description
,
eligible
areas
and
faculty
ranks
,
and
the
award
website

for
more
information
on
their
application
process
.

The
awards
are

listed
chronologically
by
their
application
deadlines
.

We

wanted
to
make
this
information
available
early
enough
so
that

faculty
,
department
heads
,
and
deans
can
have
adequate
time
to

prepare
nominations
and
applications
.

We
hope
that
this
information

will
generate
the
interest
necessary
so
that
our
top
scholars
from

across
the
university
will
be
considered
for
and
eventually
receive

these
prestigious
awards
.

It
should
be
noted
that
the
awards
are
not
only
for
longtime
scholars
.

They
vary
in
terms
of
content
areas
(
e.g.
,
humanities
,
sciences
,
art
,

or
biomedicine
)
as
well
as
nominee
rank
(
full
professor
,
mid-career

professor
,
early
career
scholar
,
or
post-doctoral
)
.

Therefore
,
please

pay
close
attention
to
the
eligibility
for
the
awards
.

I

urge
each
of
you
to
examine
the
complete
list
of
awards
and

deadlines
,
consider
possible
nominees
in
your
area
,
and
make
every

effort
possible
to
forward
their
names
in
nomination
.

My
office
will

provide
as
much
support
as
we
can
,
and
will
be
happy
to
write
letters

of
support
as
needed
.

Thank
you
for
your
assistance
in
this
important
initiative
.

in

prisoners
in
solitary
confinement
do
in
fact
“
spend
at
least
22
and
a
half
hours
every
day
in
windowless
,
concrete
cells
,
the
remaining
time
alone
in
concrete
exercise
yards
.
”

Parsing
Kernan
’s
answer
should
have
yielded
,
at
some
point
,
either
a
yes
or
no
.

Kernan
started
by
stating
that
“
solitary
confinement
is
a
word
that
’s
used
...
loosely
...
”

But
instead
of
explaining
how
he
thought
the
word
has
been
misapplied
to
Pelican	B	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
Bay	I	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
,
he
just
reverted
to
the
talking
point
that
the
guys
in
“
the
hole
”
are
the
so-called
worst
of
the
worst
.

“
[
t
]
hese
inmates
again
are
the
most
dangerous
gang
leaders
that
we
have
in
the
state
of
California	B	California	California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California	000	000
and
,
let
the
truth
be
told
,
in
the
nation
.

So
these
guys
are
really
truly
the
most
dangerous
offenders
.

So
we
have
definitely
--
Pelican	B	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
Bay	I	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
was
built
to
house
the
worst
of
the
worst
.

And
it
is
meant
to
control
their
movements
considerably
...
.

So
let
’s
just
be
very
,
very
clear
that
these
are
bad
guys
,
and
so
we
keep
them
very
controlled
.

But
it
is
not
solitary
confinement
,
nor
is
it
torturous
behavior
as
described
by
some
.

Ok
,
so
these
guys
are
the
most
dangerous
,
the
worst
of
the
worst
.

But
are
they
in
fact
kept
in
windowless
,
concrete
cells
for
22
and
a
half
hours
a
day
?

A
couple
minutes
later
,
when
Kernan
suggested
that
there
was
no
overcrowding
at
Pelican	B	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
Bay	I	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
because
the
inmates
are
housed
in
single
cells
,
Olney	B	Olney	Olney,_Maryland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olney,_Maryland	000	000
pressed
the
question
one
more
time
:
“
Well
,
are
those
single
cells
,
in
fact
,
windowless
concrete
cells
,
and
are
they
required
to
stay
there
22
and
a
half
hours
a
day
?
”

Kernan
responded
:

well
,
they
have
programming
,
I
do
n’t
know
if
I
would
say
22
hours
,
22
and
a
half
hours
a
day
,
but
,
probably
very
close
to
that
.
”

This
is
a
sizeable
number
of
words
to
say
,
in
effect
,
“
yes
.
”

What
could
be
the
point
of
Kernan
’s
filibustering
other
than
to
avoid
the
real
questions
:
Does
it
benefit
public
safety
to
house
inmates
in
a
concrete
box
?

How
do
people
react
to
extreme
isolation
?

Is
it
inhumane
to
isolate
a
person
in
a
windowless
concrete
cell
for
22.5
hours
a
day
for
months
,
years
,
or
even
decades
?

Mr.
Kernan
elected
to
end
his
interview

than
attempt
to
answer

,
welcome
back
to
our
program
.

I
understand
that
you
helped
to
resolve
some
of
these
issues
.

Which
of
those
that
I
listed
were
in
fact
dealt
with
,
and
did
the
state
make
some
concessions
?
”

Scott
Kernan
:
“
I
do
n’t
know
that
I
would
say
concessions
;
you
know
,
the
inmates
had
a
list
of
demands
,
we
took
a
look
at
them
,
and
I
think
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
realized
that
as
you
just
described
a
watch
cap
in
inclement
weather
and
a
wall
calendar
did
n’t
pose
significant
security
concerns
and
so
those
changes
were
made
.

We
’re
also
looking
at
a
number
of
things
including
the
very
complicated
gang
validation
process
.

I
’d
also
just
point
out
to
you
that
the
inmates
at
Pelican	B	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
Bay	I	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
that
started
this
are
there
because
of
their
behavior
.

These
are
the
gang
leaders
that
are
running
the
various
prison
gangs
and
as
such
are
the
scourge
of
society
in
our
prisons
.

A
lot
of
violence
associated
with
it
.

So
anyway
we
did
evaluate
it
and
we
did
make
some
changes
to
our
policy
and
we
’re
going
to
look
at
the
other
changes
that
the
inmates
desire
moving
forward
.
”

KCRW
:
“
What
about
at
the
other
prisons
?
”

Scott
Kernan
:
“
Well
really
it
was
,
again
,
generated
by
inmates
at
Pelican	B	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
Bay	I	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
.

So
the
central
issues
were
related
to
them
and
it
really
is
a
illustration
of
the
power
that
these
guys
represent
over
other
offenders
.

For
at
the
height
of
it
,
six
thousand
,
sixty-five
hundred
or
so
,
at
13
prisons
,
although
that
dissipated
very
quickly
,
and
really
the
core
hunger
strikers
were
probably
under
a
hundred
at
Pelican	B	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
Bay	I	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
.
”

KCRW	B	KCRW	KCRW	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCRW	000	000
:
“
It
’s
been
reported
that
at
Pelican	B	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
Bay	I	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
many
prisoners
are
in
solitary
confinement
,
and
then
when
they
are
they
spend
at
least
22
and
a
half
hours
every
day
in
windowless
,
concrete
cells
,
the
remaining
time
alone
in
concrete
exercise
yards
,
are
those
things
true
?
”

Scott
Kernan
:
“
The
solitary
confinement
is
a
word
that
’s
used
,
I
guess
,
loosely
,
a
little
bit
.

These
inmates
again
are
the
most
dangerous
gang
leaders
that
we
have
in
the
state
of
California	B	California	California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California	000	000
and
,
let
the
truth
be
told
,
in
the
nation
.

These
guys
are
running
the
Mexican	B	Mexican	Mexico	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico	000	000
mafia
,
the
Nuestra	B	Nuestra Familia	Nuestra_Familia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuestra_Familia	000	000
Familia	I	Nuestra Familia	Nuestra_Familia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuestra_Familia	000	000
,
the
Black
Guerilla
family
,
the
Aryan	B	Aryan Brotherhood	Aryan_Brotherhood	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_Brotherhood	000	000
Brotherhood	I	Aryan Brotherhood	Aryan_Brotherhood	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_Brotherhood	000	000
.
”

So
these
guys
are
really
truly
the
most
dangerous
offenders
.

So
we
have
definitely
--
Pelican	B	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
Bay	I	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
was
built
to
house
the
worst
of
the
worst
.

And
it
is
meant
to
control
their
movements
considerably
.

I
mean
these
inmates
are
not
there
at
Pelican	B	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
Bay	I	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
for
just
not
obeying
simple
rules
.

They
’re
in
there
for
murdering
inmates
,
and
for
you
know
following
through
with
their
criminal
enterprises
on
the
street
.

So
let
’s
just
be
very
,
very
clear
that
these
are
bad
guys
,
and
so
we
keep
them
very
controlled
.

But
it
is
not
solitary
confinement
,
nor
is
it
torturous
behavior
as
described
by
some
.
”

KCRW	B	KCRW	KCRW	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCRW	000	000
:
“
There
’s
a
panel
of
federal
judges
that
have
said
the
conditions
within
the
prisons
violate
the
constitutional
ban
on
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
.

Did
they
single
out
the
kind
of
treatment
that
I
described
?
”

Scott
Kernan
:
“
No
,
not
at
all
.

The
court
decision
that
you
described
is
overall
overcrowding
in
the
system
,
and
the
fact
that
Pelican	B	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
Bay	I	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
inmates
are
largely
single
cell
because
they
’re
so
dangerous
.

They
’re
one
of
the
few
areas
that
we
have
very
reduced
overcrowding
,
while
the
courts
ruled
that
overall
the
Department	B	Department	California_Department_of_Corrections_and_Rehabilitation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Corrections_and_Rehabilitation	000	000
’s
population
is
overcrowded
leading
to
those
constitutional
violations
;
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
SHU	B	SHU	Shu_(Egyptian_deity)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_(Egyptian_deity)	000	000
specifically
at
Pelican	B	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
Bay	I	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
or
any
of
the
other
SHUs
that
we
have
in
the
state
.
”

KCRW	B	KCRW	KCRW	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCRW	000	000
:
“
Well
are
those
single
cells
,
in
fact
,
windowless
concrete
cells
and
are
they
required
to
stay
there
22
and
a
half
hours
a
day
?
”

Scott
Kernan
:
“
Um	B	Um	University_of_Maryland,_College_Park	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park	000	000
,
well
,
they

,
I
do
n’t

if
I
would
say
22
hours
,
22
and
a

,
but
,
probably
very
close

that
.

They
get
an
hour
a
day
of
yard
and
showers
and
if
they
have
to
go
to
they
can
have
visits
and
go
to
medical
appointments
and
the
like
but
it
is
,
it
is
stark
correctional
environment
for
our
most
dangerous
offenders
.
”

KCRW	B	KCRW	KCRW	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCRW	000	000
:
“
Most
dangerous
as
they
are
,
there
are
those
who
say
that
conditions
of
that
kind
can
produce
panic
attacks
,
depression
,
inability
to
concentrate
,
memory
loss
,
aggression
,
self-mutilation
,
and
various
forms
of
psychosis
.

Is
that
true
?

And
even
if
they
are
worst
of
the
worst
,
is
it
appropriate
to
have
those
kinds
of
consequences
?
”

Scott
Kernan
:
“
Interesting
question
.

The
federal
courts
have
been
in
the
Department	B	Department of corrections	Department_of_Corrections_(New_Zealand)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Corrections_(New_Zealand)	000	000
of	I	Department of corrections	Department_of_Corrections_(New_Zealand)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Corrections_(New_Zealand)	000	000
corrections	I	Department of corrections	Department_of_Corrections_(New_Zealand)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Corrections_(New_Zealand)	000	000
and
rehabilitations
mental
health
process
for
a
long
time
and
none
of
the
inmates
that
are
involved
in
this
hunger
strike
at
SHU	B	SHU	Shu_(Egyptian_deity)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_(Egyptian_deity)	000	000
,
we
do
n’t
allow
mental
health
inmates
to
be
there
.

So
any
inmate
that
had
any
kind
of
mental
health
concern
would
not
be
housed
in
the
SHU	B	SHU	Shu_(Egyptian_deity)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_(Egyptian_deity)	000	000
at
Pelican	B	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000
Bay	I	Pelican Bay	Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Bay_State_Prison	000	000

KCRW	B	KCRW	KCRW	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KCRW	000	000
:
“
Ok
,
so
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
take
to
resolve
these
other
issues
with
what
,
you
do
n’t
want
to
call
solitary
confinement
,
and
also
with
the
question
of
gang
validation
which
they
complain
as
though
I
understand
it
that
it
takes
so
long
that
they
’re
then
accused
of
being
snitches
when
they
get
back
into
the
general
population
or
anywhere
near
it
.

I
suppose
if
they
’re
confined
to
single
cells
they
’re
not
really
in
the
general
population
.

What
about
those
issues
?

Will
that
take
you
longer
to
resolve
?
”

Scott
Kernan
:
“
It
’s
a
little
bit
more
complicated
than
that
.

What
they
’re
referring
to
is
about
the
debriefing
process
is
that
when
an
inmate
wants
to
get
out
of
SHU	B	SHU	Shu_(Egyptian_deity)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_(Egyptian_deity)	000	000
and
wants
to
disassociate
himself
with
the
gangs
he
can
do
so
and
he
has
to
go
through
a
debriefing
process
.

And
in
that
debriefing
process
he
must
identify
criminal
behavior
that
he
’s
been
involved
in
,
and
others
.

The
SHU	B	SHU	Shu_(Egyptian_deity)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu_(Egyptian_deity)	000	000
inmates
are
taking
umbrage
with
that
suggestion
,
that
that
’s
not
appropriate
.

We
completely
disagree
and
if
you
talk
to
the
inmates
that
have
went
[
sic
]
through
the
debriefing
process
and
got
out
of
the
gang
life
,
they
will
tell
you
that
the
debriefing
process
,
we
get
it
right
a
hundred
percent
of
the
time
.

So
you
know
while
we
’re
going
to
look
at
all
these
issues
,
we
definitely
think
that
there
could
be
some
changes
to
the
validation
and
debriefing
process
but
we
’re
going
to
do
that
with
the
input
of
not
only
the
stakeholders
of
the
inmate
side
but
the
stakeholders
of
the
law
enforcement
and
the
gang
investigators
that
work
so
hard
every
day
to
protect
our
streets
and
our
prisons
.

widgets
,
owners
of

will
receive
a
portion

the
advertising
revenue
generated
by
the
CBS
stations
,
which
will
be
responsible
for
selling
the
ad
inside
each
widget
.

The
recruitment
and
management
of
local
blogs
and
social
media
sites
that
will
form
the
core
of
the
CBS
Local
Ad

:
In
David
’s
song
of
thanksgiving
to
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
in
1
Chronicles
16:33
,
he
refers
to
the
time
when
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
will
come
“
to
judge
the
earth
.
”

This
foreshadows
Matthew	B	Matthew 25	Matthew_25	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_25	000	000
25	I	Matthew 25	Matthew_25	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_25	000	000
,
in
which
Jesus	B	Jesus	Jesus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus	000	000
describes
the
time
when
He
will
come
to
judge
the
earth
.

Through
the
parables
of
the
ten
virgins
and
the
talents
,
He
warns
that
those
who
are
found
without
the
blood
of
Christ	B	Christ	Jesus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus	000	000
covering
their
sins
will
be
cast
into
“
outer
darkness
.
”

He
encourages
His
people
to
be
ready
because
when
He
comes
,
He
will
separate
the
sheep
from
the
goats
in
judgment.Part
of
the
Davidic
Covenant
which
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
reiterates
in
chapter
17
refers
to
the
future
Messiah	B	Messiah	Messiah	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah	000	000
who
would
be
a
descendant
of
David
.

Verses
13-14
describe
the
Son
who
will
be
established
in
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
’s
house
and
whose
throne
will
be
established
forever
.

This
can
only
refer
to
Jesus	B	Jesus Christ	Jesus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus	000	000
Christ	I	Jesus Christ	Jesus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus	000	000
.

Practical
Application
:
Genealogies
such
as
the
ones
in
1
Chronicles
may
seem
dry
to
us
,
but
they
remind
us
that
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
knows
each
of
His
children
personally
,
even
down
to
the
number
of
hairs
on
our
heads
(
Matthew	B	Matthew	Matthew_25	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_25	000	000
10:30
)
.

We
can
take
comfort
in
the
fact
that
who
we
are
and
what
we
do
is
written
forever
in
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
’s
mind
.

If
we
belong
to
Christ	B	Christ	Jesus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus	000	000
,
our
names
are
written
forever
in
the
Lamb	B	Lamb	Lamb_and_mutton	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_and_mutton	000	000
’s
book
of
Life	B	Life	Life_(magazine)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)	000	000
(
Revelation	B	Revelation	Revelation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revelation	000	000
13:8
)
.

God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
is
faithful
to
His
people
and
keeps
His
promises
.

In
the
Book	B	Book of 1 Chronicles	Books_of_Chronicles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_of_Chronicles	000	000
of	I	Book of 1 Chronicles	Books_of_Chronicles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_of_Chronicles	000	000
1	I	Book of 1 Chronicles	Books_of_Chronicles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_of_Chronicles	000	000
Chronicles	I	Book of 1 Chronicles	Books_of_Chronicles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_of_Chronicles	000	000
,
we
see
the
fulfillment
of
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
’s
promise
to
David
when
he
is
made
king
over
all
Israel	B	Israel	Israel	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel	000	000
(
1
Chronicles
11:1
-3
)
.

We
can
be
sure
that
His
promises
to
us
will
be
fulfilled
as
well
.

He
has
promised
blessings
to
those
who
follow
Him
,
who
come
to
Christ	B	Christ	Jesus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus	000	000
in
repentance
,
and
who
obey
His
Word.Obedience
brings
blessing
;
disobedience
brings
judgment
.

and

In

God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
is
patient
with
us
and
forgives
our
sin
when
we
come

We
can
take
comfort
in
the
fact
that
He
hears
our
prayer

sorrow
,
forgives
our
sin

restores
us
to
fellowship

,
and
sets
us
on

joy

research
using
a
new

that
addresses

To
determine
how
much
income
a
working
family
needs
to
"
make
ends
meet
"
,
the
authors
of
the
report
use
basic
family
budgets
that
take
into
account
the
actual
costs
of
goods
and
services
needed
to
have
a
decent
standard
of
living
,
as
well
as
the
variations
in
these
costs
,
depending
on
where
one
lives.The
researchers
also
examined
the
role
of
public
work

programs

“
When
measuring
poverty
,
the
government
and
most
researchers
do
not
take
into
account
most
public
work
supports
,
”
said
report
co-author
Rebecca
Ray
.

“
By
contrast
,
when
we
determine
whether
a
family
is
able
to
make
ends
meet
,
we
take
into
account
the
value
of
all
of
these
benefits
.
”

The
report
also
shows
that
most
economically
insecure
workers
have
jobs
that
pay
low
wages
and
provide
few
or
no
benefits
or
“
bad
Jobs	B	Jobs	Steve_Jobs	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs	000	000
”
.

Only
a
minority
of
jobs
nation-wide
are
“
good
jobs
”
,
in
other
words
,
ones
that
pay
at
least
$
17
an
hour
and
provide
health
and
retirement
benefits
.

“
Public
work
supports
play
an
important
and
largely
unheralded
role
in
promoting
economic
security
and
opportunity
for
working
families
,
”
said
Shawn
Fremstad
,
co-author
of
the
report
and
Director
of
Bridging
the
Gaps
,
a
CEPR	B	CEPR	Center_for_Economic_and_Policy_Research	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Economic_and_Policy_Research	000	000
initiative
.

“
In
the
typical
state
,
work
supports
close
more
than
half
of
the
hardship
gap
--
the
gap
between
a
working
family
’s
income
and
the
basic
family
budget
for
where
they
live
”
.

The
authors
of
the
study
point
out
,
however
,
that
substantial
numbers
of
workers
in
low-paid
jobs
receive
only
modest
or
no
help
from
work
support
programs.According
to

uses

,
the

varies
from

I

a

favorite
of
mine
,
while
Donaldson	B	Donaldson	William_John_Donaldson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_John_Donaldson	000	000
is

of

in

However

in

I
had
a
real
love
for
11

Rac8
when
both
12
.

Qf3

and
12
.

Nf3	B	Nf3	Nitrogen_trifluoride	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_trifluoride	000	000
are
met
by
12

Qh5
.

This
favorite
of
the
late
grandmaster

Leonid	B	Leonid Stein	Leonid_Stein	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Stein	000	000
Stein	I	Leonid Stein	Leonid_Stein	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Stein	000	000
scored
well
for
Black	B	Black	White_and_Black_in_chess	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_and_Black_in_chess	000	000
in
the
mid
60s
before
some
setbacks
put

it
on
the
rubbish
heap
.

Though
it
’s

not
clear
that
this
“
Stein
Variation
”
is
actually
bad

for
Black	B	Black	White_and_Black_in_chess	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_and_Black_in_chess	000	000
,
Kapengut
wondered
if
...
Rac8
was
really
necessary
,

and
thus
he
came
up
with
11
...
Qh5
.

Black	B	Black	White_and_Black_in_chess	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_and_Black_in_chess	000	000
had
the
usual
ups

and
downs
before
this
,
too
,
was
relegated
to
the
“
theoretically

dubious
”
pile
.

11
...
Qh5
,

GOOD
OR
BAD
?

Years
went
by
and
grandmaster

Roman	B	Roman Dzindzichashvili	Roman_Dzindzichashvili	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Dzindzichashvili	000	000
Dzindzichashvili	I	Roman Dzindzichashvili	Roman_Dzindzichashvili	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Dzindzichashvili	000	000
became
interested
in

the
Accelerated	B	Accelerated Dragon	Sicilian_Defence,_Accelerated_Dragon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Accelerated_Dragon	000	000
Dragon	I	Accelerated Dragon	Sicilian_Defence,_Accelerated_Dragon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Accelerated_Dragon	000	000
and
infused
the
opening

with
many
new
ideas
.

In
particular
,
he
was

quite
high
on
11
...
Qh5
(
that
’s
how

openings
are
:
they
strike
fear
into
various

hearts
,
they
get
“
refuted
,
”
and

then
they
make
a
comeback
)
,
and
Gata	B	Gata Kamsky	Gata_Kamsky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gata_Kamsky	000	000
Kamsky	I	Gata Kamsky	Gata_Kamsky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gata_Kamsky	000	000

decided
to
give
it
a
try
,
too
.

A
brief
flurry

of
international
activity
followed
and
then
,

once
again
,
it
was
laid
to
rest
...
before

being
raised
from
the
ashes
all
over
again

by
Dzindzi
!

Since
retiring
from
active
play
,
I
find
myself
way
out
of
the
theoretical

loop
and
so
I
was
trying
to
milk
Donaldson	B	Donaldson	William_John_Donaldson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_John_Donaldson	000	000
’s
brain
.

“
John	B	John	William_John_Donaldson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_John_Donaldson	000	000
,
last

I
heard
,
11
...
Qh5
seemed
playable
.

Has
anything
new
been
discovered
?

As
a
response
,

kindly
sent
the
following
annotated
game

Jeremy
,
I
did
n’t

see
anything
convincing
for
White
when
we
wrote

our
book
and
I
still
do
n’t
see
anything

now

The

of

I
ca

The
Edge
of
Love
(
15
)

Would
the
world
be
a
better
place
without
its
artistic
types
?

I
'm
usually
inclined
to
think
very
much
not
,
but
there
were
times
while
watching
the
Welsh	B	Welsh	Wales	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales	000	000
poet
Dylan	B	Dylan Thomas	Dylan_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas	000	000
Thomas	I	Dylan Thomas	Dylan_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas	000	000
in
The	B	The Edge Of Love	The_Edge_of_Love	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge_of_Love	000	000
Edge	I	The Edge Of Love	The_Edge_of_Love	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge_of_Love	000	000
Of	I	The Edge Of Love	The_Edge_of_Love	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge_of_Love	000	000
Love	I	The Edge Of Love	The_Edge_of_Love	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge_of_Love	000	000
when
I
felt
myself
being
coaxed
into
seeing
a
simple
solution
to
the
labyrinthine
problems
of
human
relationships
:
cull
the
oversensitive
creatives
,
and
all
would
be
smooth
and
right
.

I
'm
sure
I
was
n't
supposed
to
like
Thomas	B	Thomas	Dylan_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas	000	000
,
who
's
played
by
Matthew	B	Matthew Rhys	Matthew_Rhys	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Rhys	000	000
Rhys	I	Matthew Rhys	Matthew_Rhys	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Rhys	000	000
,
but
I
'm
not
sure
if
I
was
supposed
to
dislike
him
quite
as
much
as
I
did
.
"

I
do
it
,
sleep
with
other
women
,
because
I
'm
a
poet
and
I
feed
off
life
,
"
he
tells
his
wife
,
Caitlin	B	Caitlin MacNamara	Caitlin_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Thomas	000	000
MacNamara	I	Caitlin MacNamara	Caitlin_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Thomas	000	000
(
Sienna	B	Sienna Miller	Sienna_Miller	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sienna_Miller	000	000
Miller	I	Sienna Miller	Sienna_Miller	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sienna_Miller	000	000
)
.

Of
course
,
you
could
still
just
about
get
away
with
saying
that
kind
of
thing
with
a
straight
face
in
1942
,
but
it
's
a
bit
rich
coming
from
a
bloke
who
looks
like
a
losing
quarter
finalist
in
a
regional
Rufus	B	Rufus Sewell	Rufus_Sewell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufus_Sewell	000	000

-
lookalike
competition
and
whose
poetic
contributions
of
the
previous
hour
have
included
the
ingenious
rhyming
of
the
name
"
Vera
"
with
"
Beera
"
.

The
Edge
Of
Love
tells
the
story
of
the
menage
a
trois
between
Thomas	B	Thomas	Dylan_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas	000	000
,
Caitlin	B	Caitlin	Caitlin_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Thomas	000	000
and
his
childhood
sweetheart
Vera
(
Keira	B	Keira Knightley	Keira_Knightley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keira_Knightley	000	000
Knightley	I	Keira Knightley	Keira_Knightley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keira_Knightley	000	000
)
and
,
as
such
,
comes
across
as
a
kind
of
Jules	B	Jules Et Jim	Jules_and_Jim	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_and_Jim	000	000
Et	I	Jules Et Jim	Jules_and_Jim	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_and_Jim	000	000
Jim	I	Jules Et Jim	Jules_and_Jim	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_and_Jim	000	000

readers
of

!	I	Hello !	Hello_(magazine)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_(magazine)	000	000
magazine
.

Actually
,
it
's
more
of
a
menage
a
quatre
,
since
loitering
on
the
edge
of
the
threesome
is
a
beleaguered
Cillian	B	Cillian Murphy	Cillian_Murphy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy	000	000
Murphy	I	Cillian Murphy	Cillian_Murphy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy	000	000
,
who
plays
Vera
's
husband
William
.

Not
only
is
William
by
some
way
the
most
attractive
of
these
four
people
;
he
also
has
by
far
the
most
reasons
to
feel
good
about
himself
.

While
Dylan	B	Dylan	Dylan_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas	000	000
spends
his
money
and
tries
it
on
with
his
missus
,
William
must
go
and
fight
for
his
country
.

But
,
even
given
the
role
of
the
mug
,
Murphy	B	Murphy	Cillian_Murphy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy	000	000
has
a
psychotic
twinkle
in
his
eye
that
few
directors
can
resist
taking
advantage
of
.

When
William
comes
back
to
the
bleak
Welsh	B	Welsh	Wales	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales	000	000
coast
scarred
by
his
war
experiences
in
Greece	B	Greece	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
,
matters
come
to
a
head
.

That
head
has
a
prominent
jaw
,
and
belongs
to
Miss
Knightley	B	Knightley	Keira_Knightley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keira_Knightley	000	000
.

If
you
've
found
Knightley	B	Knightley	Keira_Knightley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keira_Knightley	000	000
annoying
before
,
the
chances
are
that
in
this
film
,
directed
by
John	B	John Maybury	John_Maybury	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maybury	000	000
Maybury	I	John Maybury	John_Maybury	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maybury	000	000
,
you
'll
find
her
doubly
so
.

Not
only
has
she
hit
upon
the
ugliest
Welsh
accent
imaginable
,
her
preening
and
pouting
has
reached
a
new
low
.

Worse
,
it
appears
to
be
catching
.

In
a
scene
where
she
and
Miller	B	Miller	Sienna_Miller	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sienna_Miller	000	000
--
normally
an
actress
much
more
effortlessly
capable
of
the
kind
of
old-fashioned
lens-flirting
Knightley	B	Knightley	Keira_Knightley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keira_Knightley	000	000
seems
so
frantic
to
achieve
--
loll
on
a
bed
together
in
a
faux-lesbian
manner
,
there
's
a
genuine
worry
,
just
for
a
moment
,
that
the
two
of
them
will
merge
and
become
one
giant
jutting
,
gurning
lower-face
.
"

What
does
it
mean
when
she
smiles
?
"

one
of
those
closest
to
Vera
asks
of
her
early
on
,
and
one
senses
it
's
a
question
Knightley	B	Knightley	Keira_Knightley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keira_Knightley	000	000
would
struggle
to
answer
herself
.

If
anyone
was
hoping
that
this
would
be
a
neat
World	B	World War II	World_War_II	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II	000	000
War	I	World War II	World_War_II	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II	000	000
II	I	World War II	World_War_II	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II	000	000
companion
piece
to
last
year
's
excellent
Atonement
--
the
only
film
,
to
my
knowledge
,
where
Knightley	B	Knightley	Keira_Knightley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keira_Knightley	000	000
has
ever
really
relaxed
into
herself
--
they
'll
be
disappointed
.

The
one
thing
The	B	The Edge Of Love	The_Edge_of_Love	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge_of_Love	000	000
Edge	I	The Edge Of Love	The_Edge_of_Love	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge_of_Love	000	000
Of	I	The Edge Of Love	The_Edge_of_Love	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge_of_Love	000	000
Love	I	The Edge Of Love	The_Edge_of_Love	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Edge_of_Love	000	000
does
have
going
for
it
is
a
sense
of
the
urgency
of
love
during
wartime
;
the
feeling
that
the
rules
change
and
decisions
are
made
more
hastily
.

That
the
people
involved
in
this
love
are
largely
tedious
facsimiles
of
humankind
,
however
,
dulls
the
impact
somewhat
.

You
know
you
're
in
trouble
when
they
start
referring
to
each
other
by
their
full
names
(
"
Vera
Phillips
"
)
:
so
often
a
sign
of
a
screenplay
clawingly
desperate
for
romantic
credence
.
"

All
you
've
got
is
stories
in
your
head
,
words
,
"
Caitlin	B	Caitlin	Caitlin_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Thomas	000	000
tells
Dylan	B	Dylan	Dylan_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas	000	000
during
one
of
their
many
rows
.
"

And
I
have
to
be
real
.
"

But
sadly
the
relationship
between
Caitlin	B	Caitlin	Caitlin_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Thomas	000	000
and
Dylan	B	Dylan	Dylan_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas	000	000
's
words
seems
unreal
too
:
you
're
never
quite
convinced
as
to
why
his
poems
cause
her
to
overlook
his
thickening
,
selfish
form
and
endure
his
philandering
.

On
the
occasions
when
he
reads
his
work
to
her
,
she
just
looks
bored
,
and
the
scene
where
they
fight
after
she
flushes
one
of
his
first
drafts
down
the
toilet
feels
like
a
caricature
of
tempestuous
artistry
.

The
central
point
of
the
movie
is
adequately
conveyed
--
that
Thomas	B	Thomas	Dylan_Thomas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Thomas	000	000
's
"
pain
"
is
a
piddling
,
childish
thing
next
to
the
stuff
William
has
experienced
on
the
front
line

ffdshow
or
Perian	B	Perian	Perian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perian	000	000
.

Oftentimes
users
prefer
to
convert
Xvid	B	Xvid	Xvid	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvid	000	000
to
MPEG4
files
because
the
latter
is
more
popular
than
the
former
.

The
easiest
way
to
do
so
is
download
or
use
online
xvid
mpeg4
converter
.

The
downside
of
such
applications
,
however
,
is
their
limited
functionality
and
low
quality
.

The
good
thing
about
them
is
low
price
and
popularity
.

Somehow
,
if
you
are
the
one
who
values
high
quality

functionality
,
you
should
consider
downloading

video
converter
.

Try

are
the
12
signs
of
the
zodiac
,
and
in
Nepali	B	Nepali	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
they
are
called
Rashi	B	Rashi	Rashi	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi	000	000
.

In
Nepal	B	Nepal	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
the
moment
a
baby
is
born
,
the
first
thing
they
do
is
note
down
the
exact
time
of
birth
.

Then
it
is
given
to
the
astrologer
,
who
according
to
the
position
of
the
different
planets
in
the
solar
system
at
that
precise
moment
prepares
a
Cheena
(
horoscope
)
.

Cheena
is
a
rectangular
chart
,
which
indicates
the
degree
of
influence
of
the
planets
from
the
solar
world
on
the
people
born
to
a
particular
Rashi	B	Rashi	Rashi	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi	000	000
.

Besides
highlighting
the
positive
as
well
as
negative
aspects
of
one
’s
life
comprising
of
achievements
and
failures
,
when
it
comes
to
facing
difficult
times
the
Nepalese	B	Nepalese	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
people
go
to
their
astrologer
with
their
Cheena
for
consultations
and
they
act
according
to
his
recommendations
.

As
an
astrological
document
,
Cheena
,
they
say
,
pre-determines
the
entire
course
of
an
individual
s
life
.

For
the
Nepalese	B	Nepalese	Nepal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal	000	000
people
on
their
birthday
,
the
day
is
partly
set
aside
to
worship
their
planet
that
occupies
a
major
position
in
their
horoscope
made
according
to
the
position
of
stars
at
the
time
of
birth
.

It
is
also
a
day
for
them
to
please
the
other
ones
who
are
not
placed
in
such
a
favourable
position
in
their
Cheena
.

As
well
on
this
day
they
also
go
through
a
number
of
rituals
with
their
priest
,
who
is
offered
grains
and
cash
in
order
to
stay
in
good
health
for
the
entire
year
.

Astrologers
are
also
consulted
on
various
occasions
like
rice
feeding
,
sacred
thread
and
weddings
.

Long	I	Eddie Long	Eddie_Long	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Long	000	000
is
a
teacher
of
prosperity
theology
,
a
perverse
distortion
of
the
gospel
that
transforms
the
message
of
Christ	B	Christ	Christ	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ	000	000
into
a
message
of
secular
salvation
through
wealth
and
prosperity
.

Scholars
of
the
movement
have
studied
why
it
is
that
poor
,
disadvantaged
,
and
disenfranchised
people
seem
so
drawn
to
a
false
gospel
that
leaves
them
poor
but
makes
their
preachers
wealthy
.

They
seem
to
find
encouragement
and
hope
,
even
a
source
of
pride
,
in
a
pastor
who
preaches
prosperity
and
lives
in
ostentatious
wealth
,
even
as
they
contribute
their
own
meager
funds
.

The
Bible	B	Bible	Bible	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible	000	000
is
clear
in
warning
against
false
prophets
who
preach
false
gospels
and
those
who
would
use
spiritual
authority
for
their
own
wealth
.

The
world
is
scandalized
by
the
false
promises
of
prosperity
,
and
believers
in
Christ	B	Christ	Christ	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ	000	000
should
be
just
as
scandalized
about
this
false
promise
.

But
Christians	B	Christians	Christian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian	000	000
should
be
far
more
concerned
about
the
eternal
consequences
of
prosperity
theology
--
its
false
promise
of
salvation
through
financial
abundance
,
of
health
and
wealth
through
the
exercise
of
“
seed
faith
.
”

Missing
from
the
prosperity
gospel
is
the
message
of
salvation
through
faith
in
Christ	B	Christ	Christ	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ	000	000
alone
--
a
salvation
that
makes
every
believer
unspeakably
wealthy
in
the
grace
of
Christ	B	Christ	Christ	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ	000	000
but
does
not
promise
earthly
riches
or
unblemished
physical
health
.

Writing
in
the
“
Houses
of
Worship
”
column
in
today
’s
edition
of
The
Wall
Street
Journal
,
DeForest
B.
[
"
Buster
"
]
Soaries
,
Jr.
,
pastor
of
the
First
Baptist
Church
of
Lincoln
Gardens
in
Somerset
,
New
Jersey
,
writes
of
the
scandal
of
the
prosperity
gospel
and
its
popularity
among
African
American
churches
:

The
prosperity
gospel
--
the
idea
that
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
guarantees
truly
faithful

believers
physical
health
and
financial
wealth
--
is
not
new
.

But
cable
and

satellite
television
broadcasting
have
turned
prosperity
preachers
into

celebrities
that
have
followings
similar
to
musicians
and
movie
stars
.

A
movement
and
a
theology
that
once
seemed
like
an
aberration
among

black
churches
now
appears
to
be
mainstream
.

He
writes
further
:

Teaching
that
desire
for
more
material
possessions
is
a
sign
of
one
’s

religious
piety
is
simply
offering
a
justification
for
crass

consumerism
.

Prosperity
theology
elevates
greed
to
a
virtue
instead
of

leaving
it
as
one
of
the
seven
deadly
sins
.

Of
course
,
it
is
much
easier
for
clergy
to
preach
this
gospel
when
they

are
living
proof
that
the
“
system
”
works
.

Hence
the
celebrity-like

lifestyles
of
so
many
religious
leaders
.

The
fact
that
the
people
most

likely
to
do
well
in
the
prosperity
gospel
movement
are
the
people
at

the
top
suggests
that
it
is
all
an
ecclesiastical
pyramid
scheme
.

Soaries
seems
mostly
concerned
in
this
article
about
the
false
promises
of
wealth
and
the
economic
effects
of
these
teachings
on
African	B	African Americans	African_American	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American	000	000
Americans	I	African Americans	African_American	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American	000	000
.

All
Christians	B	Christians	Christian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian	000	000
should
share
his
outrage
and
know
that
prosperity
theology
is
found
among
all
races
and
ethnicities
.

The
television
screens
are
filled
with
their
messages
and
heresies
.

But
the
central
problem
with
prosperity
theology
is
that
is
is
a
false
gospel
.

The
prosperity
preachers
do
not
promise
too
much
.

They
promise
all
the
wrong
things
.

Of
course
,
The
Wall
Street
Journal
is
an
interesting
place
to
find
an
article
on
prosperity
theology
.

The
editors
of
that
famous
newspaper
know
what
leads
to
financial
wealth
--
that
is
their
business
--
and
they
know
that
prosperity
theology
leads
into
deeper
poverty
.

It
’s
only
those
at
the
top
who
drive
the
expensive
cars
and
ride
in
private
jets
.

was
not
unexpected
,
and
that
seemed
only
to
add
to
the
tragedy
.

His
fight
against
cancer
had
been
lived
,
like
almost
every
other
aspect
of
his
colorful
life
,
in
full
public
view
.

He
had
told
numerous
interviewers
that
he
wanted
to
die
in
an
active
,
not
a
passive
sense
.

Then
again
,
there

President
Obama
and
Same-Sex
Marriage
--
The
Dance
Continues

Thursday
,
January
5
,
2012

Some
predictions
are
rather
safe
to
make
.

2012
is
almost
certain
to
be
a
determinative
year
on
the
issue
of
same-sex
marriage
.

Multiple
courts
appear
poised
to
strike
down
the
Defense	B	Defense of Marriage Act	Defense_of_Marriage_Act	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act	000	000
of	I	Defense of Marriage Act	Defense_of_Marriage_Act	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act	000	000

DOMA	B	DOMA	Defense_of_Marriage_Act	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act	000	000
and
,
even
more
urgently
,
the
appeal
on
California	B	California	California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California	000	000

at
the

Appeals	I	US Court of Appeals	United_States_courts_of_appeals	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals	000	000
will
set
up
a
certain
appeal
to
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
Supreme	B	Supreme Court	Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	000	000
Court	I	Supreme Court	Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	000	000
.

Given
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
significance
of
the
nation
’s
most
populous
state
,
the
Supreme	B	Supreme Court	Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	000	000
Court	I	Supreme Court	Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States	000	000
is
almost
certain
to
take
the
case
.

This
sets
the
stage
for
the
courts
to
make
some
determinative
statement
on
same-sex
marriage
within
the
next
several
months
--
a
decision
that
will
go
a
long
way
toward
setting
the
direction
of
the
larger
culture
.

CIOs
looking
to
increase
business
value
from
technology

Post
credit
crisis
CIOs
will
not
be
totally
focused
on
cost
reduction
,
but
instead
looking
to
use
technology
to
add
value
to
the
organisation
.

In
the
same
month
that
saw
the
announcement
that
the
next
CEO
of
retailer
Tesco	B	Tesco	Tesco	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco	000	000
will
be
its
CIO
;
a
study
by
KPMG	B	KPMG	KPMG	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG	000	000
finds
that
CIOs	B	CIOs	Cisco_IOS	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_IOS	000	000
are
looking
beyond
the
recession
to
really
drive
the
business
forward
through
technology
use
,
just
as
Tesco	B	Tesco	Tesco	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco	000	000
did
.

ABC
music
mashup
shows
off
the
Semantic
Web

Until
recently
,
the
idea
of
a
World	B	World Wide Web	World_Wide_Web	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web	000	000
Wide	I	World Wide Web	World_Wide_Web	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web	000	000
Web	I	World Wide Web	World_Wide_Web	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web	000	000
in
which
information
and
services
are
defined
-
the
Semantic	B	Semantic Web	Semantic_Web	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web	000	000
Web	I	Semantic Web	Semantic_Web	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web	000	000
-
has
remained
something
developers
aspire
to
rather
than
a
reality
.

That
is
starting
to
change
.

Earlier
this
year
,
the
ABC	B	ABC	American_Broadcasting_Company	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company	000	000
launched
three
new
socially
networked
digital
radio
websites
which
aggregate
content
from
several
different
sources
,
including
MusicBrainz	B	MusicBrainz	MusicBrainz	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MusicBrainz	000	000
,
YouTube	B	YouTube	YouTube	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube	000	000
,
Last.fm
and
Wikipedia	B	Wikipedia	Wikipedia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia	000	000
.

It
is
not
only
a
new
approach
for
a
content-rich
organisation
such
as
the
ABC	B	ABC	American_Broadcasting_Company	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company	000	000
,
it
is
a
working
example
of
the
possibilities
of
Semantic	B	Semantic Web	Semantic_Web	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web	000	000
Web	I	Semantic Web	Semantic_Web	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web	000	000
technology

Planning
Helps
Data
Centre
Move
Go
Smoothly

It
is
n't
often
that
you
have
access
to
your
local
neighborhood
data
centre
,
literally
a
few
steps
down
the
block
.

But
I
did
.

I
live
in
a
residential
area
of
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
state
of
St.	B	St. Louis	St._Louis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis	000	000
Louis	I	St. Louis	St._Louis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis	000	000

the
Central	B	Central West End	Central_West_End,_St._Louis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_West_End,_St._Louis	000	000
West	I	Central West End	Central_West_End,_St._Louis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_West_End,_St._Louis	000	000
End	I	Central West End	Central_West_End,_St._Louis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_West_End,_St._Louis	000	000
,
and
I
pass
by
the
offices
of
the
Regional
Justice
Information
Service
(
REJIS
)
almost
every
day
.

When
I
learned
that
it
was
going
to
be
moving
its
data
centre
,
I
knew
that
I
had
to
be
there
for
the
actual
move
.

Once
principal
is

A

"

Obviously
I
'm
very
honored

his
upcoming

.
"

It
's
humbling
that
your
colleagues
would
recommend
you
for
that
type
of

Croner
,
now
in
his
third
year
at
BHS	B	BHS	Bellmont_High_School	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellmont_High_School	000	000
,
has
been
the
driving
force
behind
the
transformation

and
up

credit
towards
a

"

I
am
a
firm
believer
that
although
not
all
change
is
progress
,
all
progress
is
the
result
of
change
,
"
Croner
wrote
in
his
nominating
petition
.
"

We
as
educators
are
challenged
to
make
significant
improvements
in
our
methods
of
teaching
and
utilize
best
practices
to
improve
student
achievement
.

I
have
worked
with
the
staff
at
BHS	B	BHS	Bellmont_High_School	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellmont_High_School	000	000
and
implemented
such
practices
into

The
BHS	B	BHS	Bellmont_High_School	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellmont_High_School	000	000
principal
said
the
shift
to
an
early
college

school
model
,
the
awarding
of
physical
education
credits
through
athletics
and
a
new

are
among
the
things
we
're
doing
here
at

of
which
I
'm
most
proud

"

He
was
also
quick
to
credit
the
teaching
and

at

JUKE

Elegant	B	Elegant	Elegance	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegance	000	000
,
no
;
useful
and
entertaining
,
for
sure
:
the
Nissan	B	Nissan Juke	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
Juke	I	Nissan Juke	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
.

WHEN
CARLOS	B	CARLOS GHOSN	Carlos_Ghosn	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Ghosn	000	000
GHOSN	I	CARLOS GHOSN	Carlos_Ghosn	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Ghosn	000	000
took
over
as
CEO
,
more
than
a
decade
ago
,
Nissan	B	Nissan	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
was
bleeding
cash
and
a
lot
of
its
products
were
forgettable
,
me-too
copies
of
various
Hondas
and
Toyotas
.

Since
then
Mr.
Fix-It
--
as
he
became
known
--
has
overturned
Nissan	B	Nissan	Nissan_Motor_Company	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Motor_Company	000	000
like
,
well
,
like
a
tsunami
.

But
a
tsunami
of
goodness
!

Now
mainstream
Nissans
are
praised
for
delivering
value-for-dollar
and
fine
driving
dynamics
,
and
the
company
also
makes
lustworthy
cars
for
motorheads
(
the
370Z	B	370Z	Nissan_370Z	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_370Z	000	000
,
the
GT-R
,
the
G-series
Infinitis
)
and
even
ecophiliacs
.

Nissan	B	Nissan	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
’s
zero-emission
Leaf	B	Leaf	Nissan_Leaf	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf	000	000
is
the
world
’s
first
mass-produced
electric
vehicle
.

There
’s
a
dark
lining
to
every
silver
cloud
,
though
,
and
for
Nissan	B	Nissan	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
it
’s
the
urge
to
build
cars
for
Generation	B	Generation X	Generation_X	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X	000	000
X	I	Generation X	Generation_X	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_X	000	000
.

Or
maybe
it
’s
Y	B	Y	Generation_Y	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Y	000	000
or
even
Z
by
now
;
they
who
wear
their
ball
caps
sideways
and
call
me
“
dude
.
”

Thus
Nissan	B	Nissan	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
also
makes
the
two
ugliest
vehicles
this
side
of
the
former
Soviet	B	Soviet Bloc	Eastern_Bloc	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc	000	000
Bloc	I	Soviet Bloc	Eastern_Bloc	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc	000	000
:
the
cube
(
no
capital
letter
)
and
this
,
the
JUKE
(
all
capitals
)
.

Every
time
I
see
it
I
think
of
a
rhinoceros
calf
.

Then
I
climb
in
and
drive
away
and
am
reminded
that
rhinos
are
remarkably
agile
animals
.

And
their
babies
are
actually
sort
of
cute
.

No
question
that
the
Juke	B	Juke	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
is
right-sized
for
today
’s
new
reality
,
at
least
for
drivers
who
do
n’t
cart
Little	B	Little League	Little_League_Baseball	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_League_Baseball	000	000
League	I	Little League	Little_League_Baseball	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_League_Baseball	000	000
teams
around
.

(
It
’s
the
same
length
as
a
Mini	B	Mini Countryman	Mini_Countryman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Countryman	000	000
Countryman	I	Mini Countryman	Mini_Countryman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_Countryman	000	000
.
)

The
rear
seats
are
tolerable
for
two
adults
,
so
long
as
they
’re
not
six-footers
,
and
you
can
stack
a
week
’s
groceries
inside
the
tailgate
without
having
to
fold
them
down
.

The
back
seats
,
that
is
.

By
the
way
,
this
does
have
rear
doors
;
the
latches
are
up
there
by
the
windows
.

Fuel
economy
that
is
only
in
the
mid-20s
is
disappointing
,
but
consider
two
things
:
This
Juke	B	Juke	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
has
all-wheel
drive
,
which
adds
weight
;
and
all
Jukes
have
a
1.6-liter
,
four-cylinder
engine
tuned
for
188
horsepower
.

Those
ponies
make
the
Juke	B	Juke	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
pretty
lively
.

Dipping
into
the
throttle
squirts
the
car
through
traffic
,
while
sensors
and
a
computer
keep
a
close
eye
on
wheel
spin
.

We
’ve
gotten
accustomed
to
AWD
systems
that
split
power
between
the
front
and
rear
wheels
as
needed
,
but
this
Nissan	B	Nissan	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
can
also
divide
it
side-to-side
,
at
least
at
the
back
wheels
.

(
The
2WD
Juke
is
pulled
around
by
its
front
wheels
,
and
it
lacks
independent
suspension
at
the
rear
wheels
.
)

In
hard
cornering
or
acceleration
I
can
feel
the
car
settle
down
under
the
grip
of
the
AWD
.

Then
the
Juke	B	Juke	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
corners
nimbly
and
with
a
lot
less
understeer
than
expected
.

The
steering
is
quick
enough
to
contribute
to
this
deftness
.

A
6-speed
manual
gearbox
is
available
.

The
automatic
transmission
is
a
continuously
variable
type
with
Sport	B	Sport	Sport	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport	000	000
and
Eco	B	Eco	ECO_(Domain_Driven_Design)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECO_(Domain_Driven_Design)	000	000
modes
.

Nissan	B	Nissan	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
says
these
settings
also
tweak
the
steering
and
throttle
behavior
;
I
ca
n’t
tell
the
difference
,
but
the
CVT	B	CVT	Continuously_variable_transmission	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuously_variable_transmission	000	000
does
perform
well
.

For
2012
Nissan	B	Nissan	Nissan_Juke	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Juke	000	000
offers
eight
models

this

there

on

I
can
do

now
I
’m
just
being

the

I
was
in
Baltimore	B	Baltimore	Baltimore	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore	000	000
recently
for
meetings
with
some
of
my
biggest
clients
.

My
job
was
to
review
their
progress
in
2007
and
give
them
ideas
about
how
to
grow
their
already
profitable
businesses
in
2008
.

During
that
time
,
I
taped
an
interview
with
J.
Christoph
Amberger
for
Today
’s
Financial	B	Financial News	Financial_News	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_News	000	000
News	I	Financial News	Financial_News	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_News	000	000
,
his
multi-media
e-letter
.

In
the
interview
,
Christoph
and
I
discussed
the
coming
economic
recession
,
as
well
as
the
special
opportunities
a
declining
economy
provides
for
entrepreneurs
.

I
thought
you
’d
be
interested
in
reading
this
rough
transcript
of
our
conversation
...

JCA
:

The
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
economy
may
or
may
not
enter
a
recession
in
2008
.

But
even
if
the
economy
does
n’t
fulfill
the
technical
criteria
of
a
recession
(
two
consecutive
quarters
of
negative
growth
)
,
anyone
doing
business
or
working
for
a
business
these
days
is
experiencing
or
expecting
a
severe
downturn
.

Michael
,
we
both
have
been
through
a
couple
of
recessions
and
bear
markets
.

What
are
the
secrets
to
surviving
a
recession
--
and
maybe
even
prospering
in
an
adverse
environment
as
an
entrepreneur
?

Me
:

That
partly
depends
on
the
kind
of
recession
.

This
one
is
different
from
recent
downturns
and
stock
market
declines
in
three
important
ways
.

First
,
there
is
the
fact
of
inflation
.

Oil
has
already
hit
record
highs
this
year
.

Gold
is
on
its
way
to
$
1,000
an
ounce
.

And
a
gallon
of
gas
is
costing
$
4
in
some
states
.

Agricultural
prices
are
going
up
too
.

One
figure
I
saw
had
inflation
pegged
at
6.8
percent
on
an
annual
basis
over
the
last
three
months
.

But
it
is
actually
worse
than
that
.

Because
that
figure
was
based
on
government-supplied
data
.

Our
government
has
made
an
art
of
obfuscation
--
of
hiding
certain
economic
realities
.

Inflation
is
already
eating
away
at
our
buying
power
.

It
is
bad
and
it
is
getting
worse
.

Next
,
there
is
the
falling
dollar
.

The
dollar
is
weaker
now
than
it
has
ever
been
in
history
.

That
makes
foreign
goods
more
expensive
.

Which
increases
inflation
.

On
the
bright
side
,
it
makes
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
manufactured
goods
more
attractive
as
exports
.

But
in
most
areas
,
we
still
ca
n’t
compete
,
price-wise
,
with
China	B	China	China	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China	000	000
,
India	B	India	India	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India	000	000
,
and
the
Third	B	Third World	Third_World	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World	000	000
World	I	Third World	Third_World	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World	000	000
.

The
third
way
this
downturn
is
different
is
the
level
of
debt
.

For
the
first
time
in
modern
history
,
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
consumers
owe
more
than
they
have
.

Credit
card
debt
has
skyrocketed
.

Mortgage
debt
,
which
increased
enormously
during
the
past
10
years
as
a
result
of
irresponsible
loans
,
is
now
at
a
crisis
point
because
real
estate
values
have
fallen
,
making
tens
of
thousands
of
loans
untenable
.

It
makes
more
sense
to
walk
away
from
these
loans
than
to
renegotiate
them
.

And
behind
all
this
is
the
federal
debt
--
which
has
skyrocketed
because
of
runaway
spending
by
an
earmark-addicted
Congress	B	Congress	United_States_Congress	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress	000	000
and
Bush	B	Bush	George_W._Bush	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush	000	000
’s
$
3
trillion
war
.

These
are
our
economic
weaknesses
--
and
they
are
big
weaknesses
.

But
there
are
strengths
too
.

Unemployment
numbers
are
relatively
low
.

Earnings
are
relatively
good
.

And
new
business
start-ups
--
which
to
me
is
always
the
most
important
indicator
--
are
still
strong
.

Unemployment
will
certainly
increase
in
some
sectors
.

It
is
already
a
fact
in
the
real
estate
market
and
will
become
a
factor
in
banking
and
the
financial
industries
that
support
real
estate
.

But
other
sectors
of
the
economy
are
okay
for
the
moment
.

They
may
absorb
some
of
these
people
.

And
new
businesses
will
continue
to
create
jobs
,
as
they
always
have
,
because
of
the
amazing
growth
of
the
Internet
.

What
all
that
amounts
to
,
in
my
book
,
is
a
period
stagflation
that
may
be
followed
by
a
recession
but
may
simply
continue
to
exist
until
our
debts
have
been
paid
by
the
working
man
,
as
they
always
are
.

JCA
:

Not
everyone
is
familiar
with
the
term
"
stagflation
.
"

Me
:
"

Stagflation
"
was
coined
ages
ago
when
I
was
still
in
college
.

It
describes
an
economic
period
of
both
inflation
and
flat
growth
.

The
best
description
I
’ve
heard
was
provided
by
Rich
Karlgaard
,
publisher
of
Forbes
.

He
said
:
"

Stagflation
is
present
when
gas
and
grocery
prices
are
rising
faster
than
your
paycheck
is
--
and
in
an
economy
that
is
strong
enough
to
employ
you
but
not
strong
enough
that
you
feel
emboldened
to
ask
for
a
raise
.
"

There
are
three
ways
to
defeat
stagflation
:
(
1
)
Tighten
the
money
supply
.

(
2
)
Restrict
credit
.

(
3
)
Lower
taxes
.

When
too
much
money/too-easy
credit
is
driving
up
prices
--
that
’s
classic
monetary
inflation
.

This
should
tell
the
Fed	B	Fed	Federal_Reserve_System	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System	000	000
to
restrict
the
printing
of
money
and
tighten
credit
.

But
so
far
they
’ve
been
doing
the
opposite
because
they
are
afraid
that
if
they
tighten
credit
,
the
economy
,
which
is
already
weak
,
will
collapse
.

Lowering
taxes
,
particularly
taxes
on
individual
and
corporate
income
,
capital
gains
,
and
dividends
would
grow
the
economy
by
encouraging
investment
and
stimulating
production
.

This
is
classic
supply-side
economics
.

But
it
’s
very
unpopular
today
.

The
common
view
is
that
tax
cuts
reduce
the
effectiveness
of
government
and
increase
government
debt
.

But
the
evidence
contradicts
this
.

Government
receipts
usually
go
up
after
tax
cuts
because
the
economy
grows
and
there
is
more
income
and
profits
to
tax
.

When
you
reduce
the
cost
of
doing
something
,
you
tend
to
get
more
of
that
thing
.

Reduce
the
tax
costs
of
production
in
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
and
you
will
get
more
production
.

More
production
means
more
goods
and
services
competing
for
your
dollars
.
"

That
’s
how
prices
go
down
,
not
up
,
"
says
Rich
Karlgaard
.

It
’s
simple
.

Supply
and
demand
.

If
you
want
prices
to
go
down
,
increase
the
supply
.

Incentivize
the
suppliers
.

But
that
’s
probably
not
going
to
happen
because
it
’s
not
politically
expedient
for
politicians
to
do
it
.

Chances
are
our
problems
will
be
cured
by
a
period
of
negative
or
flat
growth
along
with
inflation
.

This
is
the
solution
preferred
by
politicians
because
it
is
a
way
for
average
consumers
to
pay
for
government
debt
and
bad
loans
without
understanding
they
are
paying
for
it
.

It
’s
another
form
of
taxation
.

Assuming
we
are
entering
a
period
of
stagflation
,
certain
investing
principles
apply
:

Cash
is
king
.

Buy
value
.

Buy
into
the
recovery
.

Invest
in
what
you
know
.

Limit
expenses
.

Be
ready
to
seize
opportunity
when
it
arises
.

Because
it
will
arise
.

JCA
:

Unemployment	B	Unemployment	Unemployment	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment	000	000
may
kick-start
some
would-be
entrepreneurs
’
plans
to
start
their
own
businesses
.

Are
there
any
particular
sectors
that
you
think
will
do
well
,
especially
for
new
businesses
?

Me
:

As
I
said
,
I
do
n’t
think
unemployment
is
likely
to
be
a
huge
problem
--
at
least
in
the
short
run
.

But
it
will
be
a
factor
.

More
important
will
be
the
squeeze
people
will
feel
from
stagflation
.

Prices
are
going
up
but
not
their
salaries
.

This
will
trigger
some
start-ups
.

And
there
will
also
be
lots
of
job
displacements
as
some
sectors
of
the
economy
--
real
estate-related
--
go
down
for
a
while
and
others
--
natural
resources
and
even
agriculture
--
go
up
.

At
some
point
in
time
--
probably
in
the
next
year
or
two
--
real
estate
prices
will
bottom
out
.

Then
the
vulture
funds
will
come
in
and
begin
to
buy
up
excess
inventory
.

When
that
inventory
is
absorbed
,
the
construction
and
building
sectors
will
revive
.

In
the
meantime
,
I
favor
:

Certain
investments
--
like
gold
,
oil
and
gas
,
natural
resources

Certain
services
--
such
as
for
legal
settlements
,
divorce
settlements
,
business
litigation
settlements
,
home
remodeling
and
repair

Information
and
advice
on
investing
,
retirement
,
estate
planning
,
entrepreneurship
,
tax
avoidance

Natural
supplements
and
pharmaceuticals

Rejuvenation
products
and
services

Retirement
homes
and
other
retirement
businesses

Soft
exercises
and
sports
--
such
as
yoga
,
Pilates
,
tai
chi

Spiritual
wealth
information
and
products

Self-improvement
information
and
products

Real
estate
(
longer
term
)

JCA
:
Judging
by
the
promises
of
our
presidential
candidates
,
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
businesses
will
almost
certainly
be
hit
with
higher
taxes
,
compulsory
health
care
contributions
,
higher
labor
costs
.

Is
it
still
worthwhile
setting
up
shop
in
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
?

Or
should
entrepreneurs
relocate
to
a
more
business-friendly
climate
...
like
Eastern	B	Eastern Europe	Eastern_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe	000	000
Europe	I	Eastern Europe	Eastern_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe	000	000
...
or
China	B	China	China	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China	000	000
...
or
the
Caymans	B	Caymans	Cayman_Islands	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayman_Islands	000	000
?

Me
:

There
is
a
big
misconception
here
.

One
I
had
until
I
began
doing
business
overseas
.

Location
of
the
business
matters
only
in
certain
industries
that
depend
on
cheap
,
unskilled
labor
.

If
you
are
producing
clothing
or
furniture
,
it
makes
sense
to
have
a
factory
in
the
Third
World
.

But
if
you
are
producing
sophisticated
products
for
which
labor
is
a
small
part
of
the
cost
--
or
selling
information
or
advice
--
you
can
do
it
from
the
U.S.

Information
and
advice
is
especially
good
because
the
brute
labor
cost
is
almost
non-existent
.

Thanks
to
the
Internet
,
the
cost
of
storage
and
shipping
is
minimal
,
so
you
can
easily
produce
your
product
here
and
sell
it
anywhere
...
anywhere
in
the
world
.

In
the
coming
recession
,
I
would
want
to
be
in
a
business
that
has
the
following
characteristics
:
(
1
)
positive
cash
flow
,
(
2
)
no
debt
,
(
3
)
no
accounts
receivable
,
and
(
4
)
no
merchandise
to
store
.

That
amounts
to
a
service
business
or
information
publishing
.

Of
the
two
,
information
publishing
is
better
.

In
fact
,
it
is
the
best
business
to
be
in
for
the
foreseeable
future
.

There
are
some
advantages
in
setting
up
overseas
,
but
there
are
also
many
disadvantages
.

I
would
not
pick
up
shop
and
open
up
overseas
unless
I
had
a
proven
formula
that
was
working
in
the
U.S.

you

Michael

Will

coming

require
entrepreneurs

to

Me
:

Entrepreneurs

You
have
to
be

do
that

When
real

prices
bottom
out

there
will

and

for

trying

JCA
:

What
are
the
biggest
mistakes
an
entrepreneur
or
business
owner
can
make
right
now
?

Me
:

There
are
three
:

Starting
a
new
business
without
knowing
anything
about
it
.

I
call
this
the
Principle
of
One
Step
Removed
.

Wasting
time
and
money
on
activities
that
are
not
directly
related
to
sales
.

Not
having
a
Disaster
Recovery/Opportunity
Plan
.

JCA
:

That
leads
to
my
final
question
for
you
:
Given
today
’s
economic
climate
,
what
does
a
new
business
have
to
have
to
give
it
the
best
chance
of
success
?

Me
:

It
’s
no
different
now
than
it
’s
ever
been
.

First
is
a
management
team
with
character
,
experience
,
and
ingenuity
.

Second
is
a
plan
that
clearly
identifies
the
way
they
will
efficiently
bring
in
customers
from
day
one
.

Third
is
their
use
of
resources
.

Will
80
percent
of
them
be
devoted
to
making
a
profitable
sale
?

The
story
of
an
unusual
relationship
--
and
how
an
unruly
giant
healed
a
broken
man
.

Chris
Gallucci
ran
away
from
home
at
12
.

By
16
he
was
in
prison
for
the
first
time
,
but
not
the
last
.

His
life
was
playing
out
on
the
fringes
of
society
,
characterized
by
rebellion
and
aggression
.

Change	B	Change	Change_(Sugababes_song)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_(Sugababes_song)	000	000
seemed
unlikely
until
he
happened
upon
the
film
set
of
Roar	B	Roar	Roar_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roar_(film)	000	000
,
a
movie
featuring

,
as
well
as
a
variety
of
lions
,
pumas
,
tigers
and
elephants
.

Chriswas
immediately
fascinated
by
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
,
the
gigantic
bull
elephant
known
for
its
misbehavior
,
and
applied
for
a
job
as
an
elephant
trainer
on
the
small
ranch
that
was
its
home
.

To
win
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
's
trust
,
Chris
chained
himself
up
in
the
elephant
's
enclosure
and
tossed
away
the
key
.

It
was
the
start
of
a
30-year
relationship
that
would
tame
the
savage
in
Chris
.

's
diary

Foreword
by
Daniel
Opitz
"

I
love
you
"
and
"
I
could
kill
you
.

The
world
the
Elephant	B	Elephant Man	Joseph_Merrick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Merrick	000	000
Man	I	Elephant Man	Joseph_Merrick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Merrick	000	000
grew
up
in
was
mean
and
hard
.

He
left
home
when
he
was
only
twelve
.

Throughout
his
teens
he
was
involved
with
the
violent
biker
culture
that
developed
in
and
around
Los	B	Los Angeles	Los_Angeles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles	000	000
Angeles	I	Los Angeles	Los_Angeles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles	000	000
in
the
late
sixties
.

Thanks
to
a
falsified
ID	B	ID	Identity_document	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document	000	000
and
too
much
pride
to
admit
it
,
he
found
himself
in
jail
for
the
first
time
at
the
tender
age
of
seventeen
.

His
only
true
philosophy
in
those
days
was
to
show
no
weakness
.

While
this
mantra
fueled
the
flames
of
his
rebellion
and
brought
him
nothing
but
trouble
,
it
also
led
to
his
eventual
salvation
:
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
was
a
five-ton
grey
giant
,
who
at
nearly
fifty
years
of
age
was
North	B	North America	North_America	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America	000	000
America	I	North America	North_America	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America	000	000
's
biggest
and
oldest
African
elephant
bull
.

As
stubborn
as
Chris
himself
,
he
too
was
unpredictable
,
fearless
and
always
ready
for
a
fight
.

Chris
was
not
looking
for
anything
more
than
a
job
and
perhaps
some
excitement
when
he
rode
his
chopper
into
Acton	B	Acton	Acton,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acton,_California	000	000
,
California	B	California	California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California	000	000
,
a
small
town
on
the
edge
of
the
Mojave	B	Mojave Desert	Mojave_Desert	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Desert	000	000
Desert	I	Mojave Desert	Mojave_Desert	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Desert	000	000
in
1975
.

He
found
a
job
as
a
welder
on
the
insane
set
of
the
movie
Roar	B	Roar	Roar_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roar_(film)	000	000
,
which
starred
over
100
wild
lions
,
cougars
,
tigers
and
two
elephants
,
as
well
as
Hollywood	B	Hollywood	Hollywood	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood	000	000
diva
and
Hitchcock
actress
Tippi	B	Tippi Hedren	Tippi_Hedren	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippi_Hedren	000	000
Hedren	I	Tippi Hedren	Tippi_Hedren	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippi_Hedren	000	000
and
her
daughter
Melanie	B	Melanie Griffith	Melanie_Griffith	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Griffith	000	000
Griffith	I	Melanie Griffith	Melanie_Griffith	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Griffith	000	000
.

When
filming
was
completed
,
Chris
and
Tippi	B	Tippi	Tippi_Hedren	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippi_Hedren	000	000
stayed
behind
with
the
wild
animals
.

Together
they
converted
what
was
left
of
the
movie
set
into
"
Shambala
--
The
Roar
Foundation
,
"
a
non-profit
organization
dedicated
to
providing
the
animals
the
best
life
possible
.

Chris
,
who
was
drawn
to
gigantic
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
from
the
very
start
,
asked
if
he
could
be
the
elephant
's
new
trainer
.

He
got
the
job
.

To
understand
what
it
felt
like
to
be
an
elephant
,
Chris
spent
the
first
night
with
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
,
attaching
himself
to
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
's
chain
and
throwing
away
the
key
.

To
gain
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
's
trust
,
Chris
learned
to
control
his
own
demons
.
"

See
,
"
he
says
,
"
The
more
relaxed
and
at
ease
I
am
,
the
more
I
allow
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
to
be
free
.
"

In
the
nearly
30
years
they
spent
together
,
neither
Chris
nor
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
got
into
serious
trouble
again
.

You
do
not
come
across
people
like
Chris
Gallucci
simply
by
chance
;
you
get
caught
in
their
gravitational
field
.

Chris
and
I
got
to
know
each
other
in
the
Bahamas	B	Bahamas	The_Bahamas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas	000	000
in
2000
,
during
a
photo
shoot
with
Nomi
Baumgartl
.

A
model
had
invited
him
along
for
his
first
vacation
in
nearly
30
years
.

After
just
a
few
days
,
however
,
Chris
cut
his
Caribbean	B	Caribbean	Caribbean	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean	000	000
trip
short
.

He
simply
could
not
bear
the
thought
that
due
to
his
absence
,
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
would
be
again
be
confined
and
chained
.

Chris
returned
to
his
own
small
world
and
self-imposed
prison
at
Shambala	B	Shambala	Shambala_Preserve	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambala_Preserve	000	000
.

I
have
always
been
drawn
to
people
who
have
pushed
the
envelope
throughout
their
lives
,
personalities
who
thrive
on
enormous
challenge
.

A
year
later
,
when
I
arrived
in
Shambala	B	Shambala	Shambala_Preserve	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambala_Preserve	000	000
with
my
film
crew
to
document
"
The	B	The Elephant Man	Joseph_Merrick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Merrick	000	000
Elephant	I	The Elephant Man	Joseph_Merrick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Merrick	000	000
Man	I	The Elephant Man	Joseph_Merrick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Merrick	000	000
,
"
Chris
was
in
the
midst
of
a
huge
personal
crisis
.

For
the
first
time
he
regretted
his
lonely
life
,
confined
to
a
ranch
in
the
desert
with
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
.

He
shaved
his
long
beard
,
sold
his
beloved
chopper
and
stopped
polishing
his
meticulously
sharpened
knives
.

But
Chris
would
not
be
Chris
if
he
did
not
manage
to
pull
himself
out
of
this
deep
depression
.

As
filming
progressed
,
he
gradually
found
his
balance
again
.

He
started
his
journal
again
,
grew
his
beard
back
and
bought
a
new
motorcycle
and
a
'57
Chevy
Bel
Air
that
he
had
always
wanted
.

We
finished
the
film
and
became
fast
friends
.

I
valued
Chris
'
simplicity
,
his
attitude
and
way
of
looking
at
things
,
his
entire
essence
,
even
Chris
just
being
Chris
.

He
never
seemed
to
need
such
modern
amenities
as
credit
cards
,
computers
or
cell
phones
.

Not
because
he
was
adverse
to
them
,
but
because
he
was
busy
with
other
more
important
things
.

To
me
,
he
represented
a
sort
of
primal
creature
with
an
instinctive
kind
of
wisdom
and
yes
,
an
undertone
of
aggression
.

In
a
strange
way
,
Chris
became
for
me
what
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
was
to
him
.

When
photographer
Nomi
Baumgartl
gets
involved
with
a
new
subject
it
is
not
only
with
her
camera
,
but
also
with
her
heart
and
entire
being
.

Nomi
was
part
of
our
film
crew
in
Shambala	B	Shambala	Shambala_Preserve	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shambala_Preserve	000	000
.

At
one
point
she
found
herself
in
the
middle
of
a
fallow
field
with
a
five-ton
elephant
hurtling
toward
her
.
"

Do
n't
move
!
"

Chris
shouted
,
"
Do
n't
move
!
"

Nomi
closed
her
eyes
and
all
was
still
.

Suddenly
she
felt
a
moist
,
warm
trunk
in
her
face
,
and
a
suction
so
strong
it
felt
as
if
she
was
being
sucked
into
a
wind
tunnel
.
"

Now
he
trusts
you
.
"

At
that
moment
she
experienced
the
wondrous
spiritual
link
between
man
and
animal
,
Chris
and
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
.

Elephant
Man
is
the
inspiring
story
of
how
a
wild
animal
tamed
a
wild
man
.

Told
through
potent
pictures
and
diary
excerpts
,
it
reflects
on
the
powerful
bond
that
can
occur
between
humans
and
animals
.

Elephant
Man
describes
their
training
regimen
,
walks
through
the
fields
together
and
the
author
's
pleasure
in
watching
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
play
in
the
water
.

Elephant
Man
is
an
intriguing
diary
of
two
stubborn
individuals
with
personality
.

It
is
a
remarkable
,
if
somewhat
insane
story
that
will
keep
you
coming
back
.

are

Animal
lovers
will
cherish
this
love
story
between
Chris
Gallucci
,
an
ex-biker
,
and
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
,
a
five-ton
grey
African
elephant
bull
...
.

Baumgard
's
photographs
of
the
two
show
an
amazing
similarity
in
their
eyes
,
facial
wrinkles
,
even
their
expressions
.

These
photos
show
less
wildness
in
Gallucci
than
intelligence
and
sensitivity
to
Timbo	B	Timbo	Timbaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland	000	000
.

Some
close
ups
could
easily
be
of
either
one
.

Giant
A/V
Quality
at
Heart
of
HDGiants

Downloaded
content
is
no
longer
a
compromise
with
the
options
from
MusicGiants
and
VideoGiants
.

Who
needs
a
5-inch
disc
when
you
can
download
movies
from
the
Internet
right
to
your
TV
?

OK
,
so
it
is
n’t
that
easy
,
but
it
’s
not
difficult
,
either
.

It
was
n’t
too
long
ago
when
we
were
thrilled
with
the
prospect
of
jamming
thousands
of
tunes
onto
a
PC
or
iPod	B	iPod	IPod	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod	000	000
.

Many
of
us
were
n’t
particularly
discriminating
about
the
quality
of
the
sound
,
though
,
and
now
that
tinny
audio
is
grating
on
our
ears
.

We
’d
like
more
elegant
solutions
.

Content
is
everywhere
,
after
all
.

Securing
high-quality
content
just
takes
a
little
more
effort
--
and
investment
--
but
the
payoff
is
worth
it
if
you
have
a
passion
for
music
and
movies
.

Audiophiles
came
up
with
their
own
solutions
for
ripping
CDs
using
lossless
codecs
.

On
the
music
store
side
,
Apple
iTunes
Plus
came
along
with
higher-res
files
that
double
the
bit
rate
for
less-compressed
audio
.

And
MusicGiants
became
the
go-to
download
service
for
high-quality
rights-protected
WMA	B	WMA	Windows_Media_Audio	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Audio	000	000
files
with
its
lossless
uncompressed
music
file
library
.

Earlier
this
year
,
MusicGiants
launched
a
sister
platform
called
VideoGiants
,
which
delivers
movies
,
concerts
and
music
videos
in
lossless
WMV	B	WMV	Windows_Media_Video	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Video	000	000
ranging
from
480p
to
1080p
resolution
using
bit
rates
of
up
to
45
mbps
.

Currently
the
site
offers
five
movie
collections
ranging
from
$
149
for
10
Star	B	Star Trek	Star_Trek	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek	000	000
Trek	I	Star Trek	Star_Trek	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek	000	000
films
to
$
1,125
for
the
eclectic
Movie
Lovers
’
Collection
of
75
movies
.

Individual
purchase
options
are
on
the
docket
.

If
typing
in
a
URL
,
logging
into
a
download
site
,
and
plugging
in
a
credit
card
number
sounds
like
more
than
you
care
to
take
on
when
settling
back
in
your
theater
recliner
,
take
note
:
Aspen
Media
Products
and
HDGiants
--
the
new
combined
brand
of
VideoGiants
and
MusicGiants
--
teamed
up
to
create
the
HD
MediaStore
application
,
which
integrates
with
electronics
connected
to
Microsoft	B	Microsoft Vista	Windows_Vista	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista	000	000
Vista	I	Microsoft Vista	Windows_Vista	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista	000	000
’s
Media
Center
Edition
.

The
application
enables
Media
Center
owners
to
legally
buy
and
download
high-quality
movies
and
music
directly
to
an
entertainment
system
via
remote
control
.

Downloaded
music
and
videos
can
be
distributed
from
the
server
’s
hard
drive
throughout
the
house
via
Media
Center
extenders
.

Over
the
next
few
months
,
other
MusicGiants
partners
will
incorporate
HD
MediaStore
into
their
interfaces
.

Look
for
Crestron	B	Crestron	Crestron_Electronics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crestron_Electronics	000	000
,
Olive	B	Olive	Olive	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive	000	000
,
Niveus
,
QSonix
,
Russound
,
Inteset
and
others
to
include
the
application
as
well
.

At
press
time
,
HDGiants
was
gearing
up
to
announce
two
additional
studio
partners
.

Downloadable
content
is
no
longer
a
compromise
.

With
hi-res
music
and
video
downloads
at
our
fingertips
,
it
’s
getting
harder
and
harder
to
justify
those
5-inch
discs
.

FRIBOURG	B	FRIBOURG	Canton_of_Fribourg	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canton_of_Fribourg	000	000
,
SWITZERLAND	B	SWITZERLAND	Switzerland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland	000	000
:
And
to
think
most
observers
thought
that
this
tie
would
be
predictable
.

It
was
anything
but
.

The
scoreline
of
1-1
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
’s
play
does
n’t
tell
half
the
story
.

There
may
be
a
discrepancy
of
1,433
places
in
the
combined
rankings
of
the
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
and
Swiss	B	Swiss	Switzerland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland	000	000
teams
,
but
the
Fed	B	Fed Cup	Fed_Cup	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Cup	000	000
Cup	I	Fed Cup	Fed_Cup	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Cup	000	000
,
as
we
all
know
,
is
a
great
leveller
and
the
host
nation
came
back
to
square
the
tie
in
a
quite
extraordinary
second
rubber
.

Stefanie
Voegele
,
leading
Switzerland	B	Switzerland	Switzerland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland	000	000
for
the
first
time
following
the
retirement
of
Patty	B	Patty Schnyder	Patty_Schnyder	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Schnyder	000	000
Schnyder	I	Patty Schnyder	Patty_Schnyder	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Schnyder	000	000
,
and
the
higher
ranked
--
by
some
99
places
--
Jarmila
Gajdosova
went
toe-to-toe
like
two
old
bare
knuckle
fighters
with
no
quarter
given
.

The
outcome
was
in
doubt
right
until
the
end
of
its
two
hour
28-minute
duration
when
the
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
,
after
saving
seven
match
points
,
finally
succumbed
60
67
(
8
)
86
.

Purists
would
have
said
it
was
far
too
hit-and-miss
to
be
a
classic
and
certainly
it
did
seem
as
if
neither
player
knew
the
meaning
of
the
word
“
rally
”
,
but
it
was
incredibly
exciting
after
the
one-way
traffic
of
the
opening
set
and
it
had
the
Swiss	B	Swiss	Switzerland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland	000	000
fans
hollering
and
cheering
throughout
the
finale
at
the
Fribourg
Forum
.

Cup	I	Davis Cup	Davis_Cup	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup	000	000

here
.

Australia	B	Australia	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
remain
the
favourites
but

Jolissaint	I	Christiane Jolissaint	Christiane_Jolissaint	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiane_Jolissaint	000	000
,
the
Swiss	B	Swiss	Switzerland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland	000	000
captain
,
expects
the
opposition
to
bring
in
Jelena	B	Jelena Dokic	Jelena_Dokic	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelena_Dokic	000	000
Dokic	I	Jelena Dokic	Jelena_Dokic	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelena_Dokic	000	000
for
Gajdosova
against
Timea	B	Timea Bacsinszky	Timea_Bacsinszky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timea_Bacsinszky	000	000
Bacsinszky	I	Timea Bacsinszky	Timea_Bacsinszky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timea_Bacsinszky	000	000
on
day
two
in
the
second
of
the
reverse
singles
.

Five
games
into
the
opening
rubber
of
her
match
against
Samantha	B	Samantha Stosur	Samantha_Stosur	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Stosur	000	000
Stosur	I	Samantha Stosur	Samantha_Stosur	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Stosur	000	000
,
Bacsinszky	B	Bacsinszky	Timea_Bacsinszky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timea_Bacsinszky	000	000
looked
more
like
the
one
to
be
stood
down
.

Playing
her
first
serious
tennis
since
seriously
injuring
her
foot
in
an
off-court
incident
last
April
the
young
Swiss	B	Swiss	Switzerland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland	000	000
,
understandably
,
looked
out
of
her
depth
against
the
world
No.
5
Stosur
.

But
both
she
and
her
captain
will
have
been
encouraged
by
the
way
she
eventually
made
a
match
of
it
before
losing
62
75
.

Bacsinszky	B	Bacsinszky	Timea_Bacsinszky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timea_Bacsinszky	000	000
lost
the
opening
five
games
as
her
serve
deserted
her
.

Jolissaint	B	Jolissaint	Christiane_Jolissaint	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiane_Jolissaint	000	000
could
not
understand
why
because
she
had
served
so
well
in
practice
,
although
credit
to
her
for
holding
serve
in
the
sixth
game
when
she
served
three
double
faults
.

She
’s
clearly
a
fighter
,
though
,
and
despite
surrendering
the
first
set
she
then
went
on
a
run
where
she
won
five
out
of
six
games
to
take
a
three-love
lead
in
the
second
set
.

Although
Stosur	B	Stosur	Samantha_Stosur	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Stosur	000	000
’s
signature
shot
,
the
forehand
drive
volley
,
was
working
sweetly
enough
,
the
rest
of
her
game
has
yet
to
return
to
the
level
of
last
year
when
she
won
the
US	B	US Open	US_Open_(tennis)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)	000	000
Open	I	US Open	US_Open_(tennis)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)	000	000
.

Nevertheless
,
she
was
still
too
good
for
Bacsinszky	B	Bacsinszky	Timea_Bacsinszky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timea_Bacsinszky	000	000
,
even
if
the
Swiss	B	Swiss	Switzerland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland	000	000
player
’s
ranking
of
No.
241
is
clearly
misleading
.

Talking
of
rankings
,
David
Taylor
,
the
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
captain
,
thought
Voegele
played
way
above
her
ranking
of
No.
138
in
defeating
Gajdosova
.

The
two
had
never
met
before
but
there
was
nothing
tentative
about
their
approach
to
the
match
.

Partly
because
the
clay
court
here
is
much
quicker
than
most
and
partly
because
of
Gajdosova
’s
hit-and-miss
style
the
match
turned
into
the
tennis
equivalent
of
a
slugfest
.

After
losing
the
first
set
60
there
seemed
no
way
back
for
the
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
but
in
an
amazing
about-turn
she
raced
into
a
5-1
lead
in
the
second
set
.

Both
players
ruthlessly
punished
their
opponent
’s
second
serve
and
even
,
on
occasion
,
the
first
.

Then
Voegele
won
the
next
four
games
and
it
was
a
brave
man
who
could
predict
the
outcome
of
this
match
.

Even
the
second
set
tiebreak
was
full
of
twists
and
turns
,
Gajdosova
taking
a
4-0
lead
before
pegged
back
to
6-6
.

She
eventually
managed
to
win
it
10-8
.

The
deciding
set
continued
in
the
same
fashion
.

It
was
impossible
to
predict
a
pattern
other
than
that
of
an
irregular
one
.

Early
Years

Lima
was
born
on
Nov.
26
,
1981
,
in
Versailles	B	Versailles	Palace_of_Versailles	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Versailles	000	000
,
France	B	France	France	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France	000	000
.

His
parents
introduced
him
to
golf
at
early
age
,
and
he
hit
his
first
golf
balls
as
a
2-year-old
growing
up
on
the
course
at
the
Saint-Nom-la-Breteche
Golf
Club
,
the
home
course
of
the
Trophee
Lancome
golf
tournament
.

His
first
golf
club
was
made
by
his
father
,
who
had
a
large
influence
on
teaching
him
the
game
in
his
early
years
.

Beginning
in
Golf

Though
both
parents
are
Portuguese	B	Portuguese	Portugal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal	000	000
,
Lima	B	Lima	Lima	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima	000	000
and
his
family
spent
his
early
years
in
France	B	France	France	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France	000	000
.

He
entered
formal
golf
training
when
he
attended
the
golf
school
at
Saint-Nom-la-Breteche
as
a
7-year-old
.

It
was
at
this
point
that
his
interest
in
golf
escalated
to
a
true
passion
,
and
he
and
his
parents
began
to
focus
much
of
his
time
on
the
sport
.

Early
Career

By
the
end
of
2001
,
the
20-year-old
Lima
had
escalated
his
game
to
the
top
spot
on
the
French	B	French	France	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France	000	000
amateur
scene
.

He
turned
professional
early
the
following
year
for
the
beginning
of
the
season
.

He
golfed
for
France	B	France	France	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France	000	000
for
the
first
three
years
of
his
career
,
using
the
name
Jose
Filipe
.

His
first
professional
post
was
on
the
Alps	B	Alps Tour	Alps_Tour	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps_Tour	000	000
Tour	I	Alps Tour	Alps_Tour	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps_Tour	000	000
in
central	B	central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
Europe	I	central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
,
where
he
moved
up
to
the
No.
4

ranking
by
the
next
year
.

Success

His
high
ranking
in
the
Alps	B	Alps Tour	Alps_Tour	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps_Tour	000	000
Tour	I	Alps Tour	Alps_Tour	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps_Tour	000	000
earned
him
a
spot
on
the
more-coveted
Challenger
Tour
for
the
beginning
of
the
2004
season
.

Though
he
had
success
on
the
Alps	B	Alps Tour	Alps_Tour	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps_Tour	000	000
Tour	I	Alps Tour	Alps_Tour	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps_Tour	000	000
,
he
gained
his
first
tournament
win
at
the
Segura
Viudas
Challenge
of
Spain	B	Spain	Spain	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain	000	000
.

Soon
after
he
began
to
represent
Portugal	B	Portugal	Portugal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal	000	000
,
instead
of
France	B	France	France	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France	000	000
,
on
the
tour
and
re-adopted
his
birth
name
.

He
went
on
to
win
the
AA
St.
Amer
Open
in
2004
.

Rise
in
the
World
Rankings

After
his
2004
success
,
Lima	B	Lima	Lima	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima	000	000
rose
to
be
the
73rd-ranked
player
in
the
European	B	European Tour	PGA_European_Tour	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour	000	000
Tour	I	European Tour	PGA_European_Tour	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour	000	000
classification
and
became
the
highest-ranked
Portuguese	B	Portuguese	Portugal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal	000	000
player
ever
in
2005
.

His
play
in
two
years
on
the
European	B	European Tour	PGA_European_Tour	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour	000	000
Tour	I	European Tour	PGA_European_Tour	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour	000	000
earned
him
his
tour
card
for
2007
,
and
his
other
wins
over
this

PSTScience
fiction
is
fantasyI
originally
wrote
this
a
couple
of
years
ago
when
I
was
called
upon
to
defend

an
assertion
--
that
science
fiction
is
best
regarded
as
a
special
case
of
fantasy
.

I
would
like
to
start
with
a
little
essay
about
how
I
came
to
this
conclusion

--
that
science
fiction
is
actually
a
subset
of
fantasy
--
because
it
defines

terms
and
addresses
many
counterpoints
that
have
been
raised
.

First
,
when
I
say
"
fantasy
"
I
refer
to
stories
that
are
about
things

that
are
n't
.

This
includes
both
the
purely
imaginative
(
probably
wo
n't

happen
)
and
the
speculative
(
might
happen
)
.

Fantasy
in
this
sense
is
not
on

a
continuum
against
science
fiction
,
it
is
on
a
continuum
against
realism
.

(
Although
"
continuum
"
implies
that
it
's
something
resembling
a
straight
line
,
which
I
would
not
be
willing
to
defend
.
)

One
possible
rule
of
thumb
:
it
is
a
fantasy
if
filming
it
would
require
obvious
special
effects
.

There
is
a
smaller
definition
of
fantasy
,
call
it
fantasy
definition
2
,
which
basically
means
"
vaguely
resembling
Tolkien	B	Tolkien	J._R._R._Tolkien	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien	000	000
.
"

I
believe
this
is
a
marketing
distinction
rather
than
a
literary
one
,
since
it
does
n't
even
include
most
fantasy
.

It
does
have
a
vigorous
fan
base
,
however
.

That
fact
leads
the
term
"
fantasy
"
to
be
used
as
shorthand
for
"
this
particular
type
of
fantasy
involving
elves
and
dragons
and
such
.
"

So
--
those
types
of
stories
clearly
are
fantasy
,
but
they
are
not
the
definition
of
fantasy
.

They
are
not
the
container
,
they
are
one
of
the
things
contained
.

Most
of
what
we
think
of
as
"
genre
"
is
really
just
marketing
.

They
put
the
books
in
whatever
section
they
expect
people
to
look
for
them
in
.

So
,
The	B	The Handmaid 's Tale	The_Handmaid's_Tale_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid's_Tale_(film)	000	000
Handmaid	I	The Handmaid 's Tale	The_Handmaid's_Tale_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid's_Tale_(film)	000	000
's	I	The Handmaid 's Tale	The_Handmaid's_Tale_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid's_Tale_(film)	000	000
Tale	I	The Handmaid 's Tale	The_Handmaid's_Tale_(film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Handmaid's_Tale_(film)	000	000
is
in
unclassified
"
literature
"
because
Margaret	B	Margaret Atwood	Margaret_Atwood	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Atwood	000	000
Atwood	I	Margaret Atwood	Margaret_Atwood	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Atwood	000	000
is
n't
marketed
as
a
science
fiction
writer
.

It
does
n't
have
any
bearing
on
whether
the
book
is
science
fiction
.

And
it
's
not
supposed
to
.

It
's
supposed
to
help
Atwood	B	Atwood	Margaret_Atwood	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Atwood	000	000
fans
find
her
stuff
.

Sufficiently
popular
fantastic
writers
will
often
get
moved
to
the
"
literature
"
section
--
it
does
n't
make
any
difference
to
the
content
of
the
books
.

One
common
way
people
attempt
to
distinguish
science
fiction
from
(
other
)
fantasy
is
to
claim
that
science
fiction
is
about
what
is
"
possible
.
"

This
definition
is
problematic
because
"
possible
"
is
not
intrinsic
to
the
work
.

Real
world
possibilities
are
always
shifting
--
some
things
that
seemed
impossible
once
are
now
possible
,
other
things
which
once
seemed
possible
are
now
thought
to
be
impossible
.

Re
:
any
50s
science
fiction
about
faster
than
light
travel
,
or
life
on
the
Moon	B	Moon	Moon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon	000	000
or
Mars	B	Mars	Mars	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars	000	000
.

This
definition
would
lead
us
to
the
fairly
awkward
position
of
deciding
that
most
"
golden
age
"
SF	B	SF	Science_fiction	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction	000	000
is
no
longer
science
fiction
,
because
it
is
now
known
to
be
fantasy
.

But
,
people
do
n't
tend
to
do
that
--
we
still
see
Podkayne	B	Podkayne	Podkayne_of_Mars	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podkayne_of_Mars	000	000
of
Mars	B	Mars	Mars	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars	000	000

as
science
fiction
.

So
obviously
,
we
're
using
a
qualifier
other
than
"
what

is
now
possible
.
"

You
might
at
this
point
be
tempted
to
use
"
what
the
author
thought
was
possible
at
the
time
it
was
written
"
as
a
qualifier
,
but
this
is
still
problematic
,
because
the
author
's
personal
beliefs
are
also
not
intrinsic
to
the
work
.

We
ca
n't
conclude
that
every
SF	B	SF	Science_fiction	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction	000	000
writer
who
deals
in
time
travel
to
the
past
actually
believes
such
a
thing
is
possible
.

So
,
what
makes
something
science
fiction
,
if
it
is
n't
the
fact
that
its
scientific
premise
is
possible
,
or
that
the
author
believed
it
was
possible
when
the
story
was
written
?

Well
,
let
's
look
at
Frankenstein	B	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein	000	000
,
held
by
many
to
be
the
first
science

fiction
novel
.

Mary	B	Mary Shelley	Mary_Shelley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley	000	000
Shelley	I	Mary Shelley	Mary_Shelley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley	000	000
writes
of
a
man
assembling
a
new
man
out
of
parts

of
dead
men
,
then
bringing
him
to
life
through
unspecified
scientific
means
.

(
Note
:
movies
have
implied
that
this
means
was
electricity
.

The
novel
does
n't
say
,
ostensibly
because
Dr.
Frankenstein	B	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein	000	000
does
n't
want
anyone
to
replicate
his
methods
.

But
other
writings
by
Mary	B	Mary Shelley	Mary_Shelley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley	000	000
Shelley	I	Mary Shelley	Mary_Shelley	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley	000	000
at
the
time
show
that
she
was
familiar
with
experiments
in
galvanism
and
that
her
knowledge
that
a
frog
's
limb
could
be
brought
to
"
life
"
with
electricity
probably
did
influence
her
thinking
when
writing
the
novel
.
)

There
was
no
concept
of
scientifiction	B	scientifiction	Science_fiction	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction	000	000
(
early
name
for
SF	B	SF	Science_fiction	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction	000	000
)
in
her
day
,
so
in

her
mind
she
was
writing
a
horrific
fantasy
,
and
her
twist
on
it
was
to
involve

modern
science
.

Also
,
we
now
know
that
what
she
describes
in
Frankenstein	B	Frankenstein	Frankenstein	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein	000	000

is
impossible
--
an
intact
and
very
recently
deceased
body
might
be
brought

back
to
life
through
electricity
,
but
a
sewn-together
collection
of
corpses

never
could
.

And
yet
,
the
book
is
retroactively
classified
as
science
fiction
,
and
nobody
seriously
objects
.

Why
is
that
?

Well
,
its
premise
is
scientific
--
it
can
be
expressed
as
"
suppose
,
using
science
,
we
could
do
X.
"
Also
,
it
is
concerned
with
the
effect
of
technology
and
scientific
discoveries
on
the
human
psyche
and
human
society
,
addressing
concepts
such
as
unintended
consequences
and
creator
responsibility
.

So
,
it
is
science
fiction
because
it
wrestles
with
scientific
issues
and
concepts
.
"

Being
science
fiction
"
is
essentially
an
attribute
of
what
is
otherwise
a
fantasy
novel
.

But
,
if
you
still
think
SF	B	SF	Science_fiction	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction	000	000
and
fantasy
are
two
distinct
and
separate
genres
,

consider
:
Is
alternate
history
science
fiction
,
because
it
is
generally
published

as
science
fiction
?

Or
is
it
only
science
fiction
if
it
involves
quantum
multiple

universes
theory
,
or
if
the
change
catalyst
is
something
specifically
scientific
?

(
I
mean
,

,
which
is

specifically

based

technology
,
as
opposed
to

Labels

character
.

'_'
is
regarded
as
alphabetic
.

They
are

only
the

Local
labels
may
be
defined
as
decimal
numbers
.

The

label
may
be

defined
repeatedly

A
local
label
is
referenced
using
a
'

,
thus
:

The
reference
may

which
sets

by
adding

From

one
to
four
instructions
may
be
generated
.

ADRn

The

,

or
earlier
with
a
LITERAL	B	LITERAL	Literal_(computer_programming)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_(computer_programming)	000	000
directive
.

LDRH
will
generate
half

.

Literals
will
be
aliased
to
earlier
constants

of
the
same
value
,
where
possible
.

Literal
pools
are
aligned
automatically
,
as

deemed
necessary
by
the
assembler

and

terminate

Rn	B	Rn	Registered_nurse	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_nurse	000	000
,
#nn
A
number
of
`
extended
'
immediate
operations

which
are
synthesized
from
real
operations
but

allow
arbitrary
sized
immediate
fields
.

From

one
to
four
instructions
may
be
generated
;

some
substitution
(
e.g.
SUB
for
ADD	B	ADD	Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_predominantly_inattentive	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder_predominantly_inattentive	000	000
)
will
be

attempted
if
it
shortens
the
sequence
.

Operations
supported
are
{
MOVX
,
ADDX
,
ADCX
,

SUBX
,
SBCX
,
RSBX
,
RSCX
,
ANDX
,
BICX
,
ORRX
,

EORX
}
.

Conditional
operation
and
flag
setting
is

optional
;
NOTE
that
an
attempt
to
set
the
C
or

V
FLAG
will
result
in
an
UNDEFINED	B	UNDEFINED	Undefined_(mathematics)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_(mathematics)	000	000
state
as

predicting
where
an
overflow
may
occur
is
not

possible
and
the
flags
can
only
be
set
on
the

last
instruction
in
the
sequence
.

These
sequences
may
provide
a
convenient
means

of
performing
some
operations
but
should
be

used
with
caution
.

An
advantage
of
this
mechanism
over
"
LDR
=
"
is

that
the
data
is
fetched
from
the
code
stream

rather
than
as
data
;
thus
the
constants
are

more
easily
integrated
with
instruction

caches
,
etc.
.

Notes
for
Thumb	B	Thumb	Thumb	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb	000	000
:

NOP
is
MOV
R8
,
R8
because
MOV
R0
,
R0
would
affect
the
flags
.

Only
ADR	B	ADR	American_depositary_receipt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_depositary_receipt	000	000
(
and
ADR1
)
are

were
close
behind
.

After
two
laps
,
Wells	B	Wells	Todd_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Wells	000	000
bridged
to
Powers	B	Powers	Jeremy_Powers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Powers	000	000
and
the
two
traded
attacks
until
Wells	B	Wells	Todd_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Wells	000	000
crashed
and
bent
his
derailleur
on
the
last
lap
.

Powers	B	Powers	Jeremy_Powers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Powers	000	000
decided
not
to
attack
Wells	B	Wells	Todd_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Wells	000	000
until
he
went
into
the
pit
to
take
another
bike
,
then
he
punched
it
to
take
about
a
five-second
gap
that
Wells	B	Wells	Todd_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Wells	000	000
quickly
closed
.

From
there
,
it
looked
to
be
a
repeat
of
Saturday
's
race
,
when
Wells	B	Wells	Todd_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Wells	000	000
came
around
Anthony
to
nip
him
at
the
line
.

But
this
time
,
Wells	B	Wells	Todd_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Wells	000	000
attacked
Powers	B	Powers	Jeremy_Powers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Powers	000	000
about
a
kilometer
from
the
finish
and
Powers	B	Powers	Jeremy_Powers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Powers	000	000
had
to
close
a
small
gap
on
the
final
straight
to
win
by
a
hand
's
width
.
"

He
got
a
little
gap
,
maybe
two
bike
lengths
,
coming
into
the
last
straight
,
"
Powers	B	Powers	Jeremy_Powers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Powers	000	000
said
.
"

Maybe
it
was
a
little
too
much
,
but
Todd	B	Todd	Todd_Wells	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Wells	000	000
hit
a
root

returned
to

missing
the

Behind

,
Amy
Wallace

also
got

kept

for
about

Today
I
was
feeling
good

up

told

I
can

I
saw

,

How
to
choose
an
email
for
tweens

Author

First
of
all
,
a
confession
.

I
am
a
shoemaker
and
my
children
have
no
shoes
.

I
’ve
been
working
in
the
Internet
since
1996
,
but
my
daughter
,
at
11
,
is
clearly
the
last
one
in
her
class
to
get
an
email
.

Opening
that
Pandora
’s
Box
is
something
that
I
push
off
month
to
month
,
day
to
day
,
hour
to
hour
.

Now
,
at
long
last
,
a
teacher
is
requiring
that
all
six
graders
have
an
email
.

It
’s
almost
Halloween	B	Halloween	Halloween	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween	000	000
and
we
have
not
yet
bowed
down
to
the
edict
.

If
you
’re
scared
of
email
for
your
kids
,
there
are
surprisingly
few
resources
.

If
you
want
them
to
play
more
games
,
there
are
a
million
walled
gardens
all
willing
to
take
your
money
.

There
are
lots
of
filters
for
internet
use
,
Net
Nanny
and
Apple	B	Apple	Apple_Inc.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.	000	000
’s
built-in
parental
controls
among
them
.

And
,
there
are
plenty
of
kiddy
email
sites
that
allow
your
infant
a
happy
place
to
click
on
lots
of
letters
without
messing
up
the
computer
too
much
,
and
these
progress
up
to
age
8
,
9
,
or
maybe
10
.

But
if
you
have
waited
until
your
daughter
is
almost
12
to
give
her
an
email
,
she
will
cry
,
as
mine
did
,
when
you
suggest
she
go
to
a
site
called
Zilladog
to
access
her
email
.

So
,
it
’s
a
sorry
state
,
but
we
’ll
likely
get
her
a
Gmail	B	Gmail	Gmail	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail	000	000
account
and
monitor
it
ourselves
until
she
is
a
bit
older
.

I
’m
not
overjoyed
by
this
,
but
my
baby
is
growing
up
.

Still
,
there
are
some
parental
tasks
left
to
do
,
and
first
among
them
is
choosing
a
screen
name
.

There
is
nothing
I
could
find
online
on
this
,
except
for
one
thin
forum
post
on
choosing
a
screen
name
.

So
here
is
what
I
’ve
come
up
with
as
a
guideline
for
my
daughter
:

1
.

No
real
names
.

She
can
use
a
nickname
or
some
random
word
,
but
nothing
that
identifies
her
personally
.

2
.

No
ID	B	ID	Identity_document	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document	000	000
that
she
’s
a
girl
.

So
no
girlygirl@gmail.com
.

This
does
n’t
surprise
her
at
all
for
some
reason
and
I
’m
happy
I
do
n’t
have
to
explain
why
I
’m
being
careful
.

3
.

No
years
,
like
her
birth
year
or
the
current
year
so
that
she
is
n’t
marked
by
a
certain
era
.

Plus
adding
123
after
your
chosen
name
is
so
AOL	B	AOL	AOL	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL	000	000
circa
1999
.

Unfortunately
,
with
over
2
billion
internet
users
(
Nielsen	B	Nielsen	Nielsen_ratings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings	000	000
March
2011
)
and
who
knows
how
many
on
gmail
,
almost
any
combo
of
words
is
already
taken
until
you
get
into
phrases
that
are
out
of
common
usage
.

Still
,
the
rules
are
in
place
and
we
may
have
to
keep
searching
a
bit
together
.

Otherwise
,
she
can
start
using
her
new
email
:
elephantupstaircase@gmail.com
as
early
as
tonight
.

As
a
publisher
,
I
’m
happy
to
see
the
New	B	New York Times	The_New_York_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times	000	000
York	I	New York Times	The_New_York_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times	000	000
Times	I	New York Times	The_New_York_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times	000	000
take
a
real
lead
on
paid
content
.

I
’ve
always
thought
that
the
Web
wants
to
be
“
FREE
,
”
but
everyone
knows
that
anything
that
is
always
given
away
free
turns
into
garbage
.

And
that
’s
the
road
most
print
publications
are
on
unless
they
change
their
model
.

The
New	B	New York Times	The_New_York_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times	000	000
York	I	New York Times	The_New_York_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times	000	000
Times	I	New York Times	The_New_York_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times	000	000
ca
n’t
continue
to
create
leadership
journalism
as
it
watches
home
delivery
and
newsstand
sales
dwindle
to
those
few
remaining
octogenarians
who
want
the
inky
,
bulky
broadsheet
hanging
into
their
cereal
(
Full
disclosure
:
I
’m
one
of
them
)
.

While
Google	B	Google AdSense	AdSense	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdSense	000	000
AdSense	I	Google AdSense	AdSense	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdSense	000	000
can
make
publishers
a
few
dimes
and
nickels
each
month
,
it
’s
revenue
potential
is
way
over-stated
and
decreasing
.

There
has
to
be
another
way
.

I
love
the
NYT
solution
for
the
following
reasons
:

1
.

It
provides
a
benefit
and
distinction
for
home
subscribers
.

Part
of
this
reaction
is
selfish
,
since
I
’ve
subscribed
since
I
lived
in
New	B	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
York	I	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
fifteen
years
ago
.

But
it
stands
to
reason
that
you
promote
sales
by
giving
benefits
to
the
people
who
increase
your
value
as
an
asset
.

And
,
advertisers
like
to
see
paid
subscription
since
it
connotes
involvement
.

2
.

It
allows
people
to
get
a
little
bit
for
free
.

They
have
n’t
yet
said
how
many
articles
per
month
you
will
get
for
“
free
”
as
a
non-subscriber
,
but
it
’s
at
least
ten
,
that
should
give
you
enough
to
read
your
favorite
columnists
or
features
every
month
.

Beyond
that
,
as
with
public
radio
,
you
really
should
be
donating
something
anyway
.

3
.

It
keeps
the
NYT	B	NYT	The_New_York_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times	000	000
open
to
Google	B	Google	AdSense	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdSense	000	000
and
Bing	B	Bing	Bing	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing	000	000
searches
.

I
always
thought
this
was
the
way
things
should
go
.

Allow
the
NYT	B	NYT	The_New_York_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times	000	000
to
be
searchable
via
search
engines
so
people
can
find
the
best
info
online
and
perhaps
discover
the
Times	B	Times	The_New_York_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times	000	000
.

4
.

Most
importantly
,
it
still
allows
bloggers
to
tell
the
world
about
stories
they
find
in
the
NYT	B	NYT	The_New_York_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times	000	000
,
without
resorting
to
copying
articles
wholesale
.

I
often
make
a
comment
on
an
article
,
providing
an
interesting
snipped
with
a
link
to
the
full
article
.

The
NYT	B	NYT	The_New_York_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times	000	000
will
still
allow
this
though
clicking
the
link
will
count
towards
the
monthly
quota
for
unpaid
users
.

This
should
help
the
New	B	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
York	I	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
Time	B	Time	Time_(magazine)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)	000	000
get
more
readers
while
not
destroying
their
model
.

This
is
the
system
the
New	B	New Yorker	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
Yorker	I	New Yorker	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
should
use
as
well
.

It
’s
fun
to
send
an
great
article
to
someone
who
is
not
a
reader
.

It
’s
not
good
if
someone
is
reading
the
whole
thing
on
line
while
everyone
else
is
paying
.

And
face
it
,
a
new
generation
of
readers
is
growing
up
and
they
are
happy
reading
a
book
or
magazine
on
an
iPhone	B	iPhone	IPhone	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone	000	000
rather
than
a
physical
magazine
.

Hats
off
to
the
New
York
Times

Why

It
’s
true
most
parenting
magazines
have
mom-free
names
and
try
to
insert
a
page
or
two
“
just
for
dad
,
”
but
the
reason
the
overwhelming
amount
of
content
is
geared
toward
the
female
persuasion
has
a
lot
less
to
do
with
the
editors
than
it
does
the
people
who
are
paying
to
get
the
magazine
out
the
door
:
the
advertisers
.

Sorry
Dad
--
but
they
do
n’t
care
if
you
want
five
friendly
recipes
for
adding
veggies
to
your
kid
’s
diet
.

They
want
to
sell
your
wife/girlfriend
a
package
of
organic
waffles
with
broccoli
ground
up
inside
.

Because
the
studies
show
she
’s
the
one
more
likely
to
buy
them
.

Women
are
widely
touted
as
the
controllers
of
the
family
purse
strings
--
even
in
families
where
there
are
shared
checking
accounts
.

The
common
number
you
hear
?

About
eighty
percent
of
family
spending
is
done
by
the
female
head
of
household

Bad
news
for
those
of
us
trying
at
least
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
Pampers	B	Pampers	Pampers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pampers	000	000
by
writing
about
our
dad
experiences
.

Until
we
become
a
real
economic
force
,
dads
are
an
add-on
.

But
why
is
that
when
dads
are
involved
,
or
usually
lead
,
the
very
big
ticket
items
,
like
the
choice
of
the
mini
van
or
the
new
long-term
life
insurance
plan
.

As
I
mentioned
a
few
posts
back
,
this
year
at
the
ABC
Kids
show
in
Vegas	B	Vegas	Las_Vegas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas	000	000
,
“
dad
”
was
integrated
into
all
the
marketing
materials
.

Maybe
dad
is
n’t
doing
the
weekly
shopping
but
he
is
weighing
in
heavily
on
which
stroller
he
is
willing
to
push
down
the
street
,
or
which
car
seat
he
’s
going
to
move
in
and
out
of
the
car
.

Dads
do
think
differently
than
moms
,
and
the
sexes
will
likely
continue
to
have
their
own
sweet
spots
and
obsessions
,
but
count
on
more
and
more
dads
to
be
making
the
choice
of
the
family
toothpaste
and
even
the
diapers
as
we
take
a
more
active
role
in
“
home
”
and
even
stay
there
to
be
with
the
kids
.

;
The
Ox
Anthology
,

I
guess
my
problem
is
with
who
's
doing
the
selecting
.

This
two-disc
compilation
of
the
late
Who
bass
player
Entwistle	B	Entwistle	John_Entwistle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Entwistle	000	000
's
solo
career
is
chronologically
arranged

starting
with

album

Wall	I	Smash Your Head Against the Wall	Smash_Your_Head_Against_the_Wall	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smash_Your_Head_Against_the_Wall	000	000
.

It
finishes
with
some
live
performances
and
,
of
all
things
,
music
from
a
failed
cartoon
series
"
Van-pires
.
"

While
many
of
the
studio
songs
from
the
first
three
or
four
albums
are
what
Entwistle
was
all
about
,
many
of
the
later
offerings
are
the
bass
player
's
best
Who
songs
,
but
unfortunately
not
with
The	B	The Who	John_Entwistle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Entwistle	000	000
Who	I	The Who	John_Entwistle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Entwistle	000	000

them
.

Entwistle	B	Entwistle	John_Entwistle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Entwistle	000	000
often
complained
in
the
'70s
that

Who	I	The Who	John_Entwistle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Entwistle	000	000
were
n't
rocking
hard
enough
in
their
studio
work
.

Ironically
except
for
a
couple
of
songs
on
Smash
You
Head
...
,
and
his
second
album
Whistle	B	Whistle Rymes	Whistle_Rymes	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistle_Rymes	000	000
Rymes	I	Whistle Rymes	Whistle_Rymes	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistle_Rymes	000	000
,
most
of
his
solo
work
was
much
tamer
musically
than
Pete	B	Pete Townshend	Pete_Townshend	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Townshend	000	000

Compare

'
single
.

Puzzling
was
also
the
absence
of
memorable
bass
lines
in
any
studio
work
.

You
have
to
go
to
the
live
versions
on
Who
songs
in
the
anthology
to
find
any
examples
of
Entwistle
's
virtuosity
as
a
bass
player
.

In
my
opinion
,
he
is
one
of
the
finest
four-string
(
OK
fans
,
also
eight-string
)
thumpers
ever
to
strap
on
a
Thunderbird	B	Thunderbird	Gibson_Thunderbird	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Thunderbird	000	000
.

Yet
his
solo
work
is
dominated
primarily
by
keyboards
.

Being
an
accomplished
French	B	French Horn	Horn_(instrument)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_(instrument)	000	000
Horn	I	French Horn	Horn_(instrument)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_(instrument)	000	000
player
,
though
,
did
promote
the
use
of
brass
throughout
the
early
albums
.

A
great
example
is
"
I
Wonder
,
"
with
Entwistle
(
and
his
carpenter
on
trombone
!
)

blasting
through
kicking
horn
lines
.

The
anthology
's
first
CD
takes
us
through
the
four
initial
albums
,
with
a
couple
live
tracks
from
1975
.

This
where
you
can
hear
the
dark
humor
that
was
Entwistle
's
song
writing
niche
.

His
black
humor
comes
through
on
songs
like
"
Made
in
Japan	B	Japan	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000
,
"
with
lines
such
as
,
"
I
did
n't
buy
the
car
so
I
decided
to
get
married
instead
.
"

The
great
"
I
Wonder
,
"
pondering
childlike
with
"
I
wonder
what
would
happen
if
my
fish
could
fly
,
would
he
leap
from
the
tank
and
hit
the
cat
in
the
eye
?
"

but
finishing
Entwistle
style
,
"
Out
through
the
window
into
the
sky
,
I
'm
so
glad
sharks
ca
n't
fly
.
"

Entwistle
's
dark
wit
can
be
found
in
most
of
his
early
solo
works
,
e.g.
"
Pick
Me
Up
(
Big
Chicken
)
"
a
song
about
being
barely
conscious
drunk
,
"
Who
Cares
"
extolling
the
virtues
of
being
a
slacker
,
or
"
Thinking	B	Thinking It Over	Thinking_It_Over	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_It_Over	000	000
It	I	Thinking It Over	Thinking_It_Over	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_It_Over	000	000
Over	I	Thinking It Over	Thinking_It_Over	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_It_Over	000	000
"
about
a
suicidal
husband
deciding
if
unfaithfulness
is
worth
killing
oneself
over
,
while
worrying
about
wasting
the
police
's
time
.

You
need
to
listen
closely
to
Entwistle
's
songs
.

And
then
we
have
"
Peg
Leg
Peggy
,
"
an
appendage
challenged
girlfriend
described
"
when
it
comes
to
dancing
she
's
the
queen
,
she
sounds
just
like
a
sewing
machine
.
"

The
Ox
was
never
politically
correct
,
unless
there
was
a
funny
song
in
being
so
.

The
second
disc
is
where
I
have
the
most
problems
with
the
anthology
.

While
I
may
have
chosen
a
couple
different
songs
from
the
first
four
albums
(
big
error
leaving
"
Big
Black
Cadillac
"
out
)
,
the
bulk
of
the
second
CD	B	CD	Compact_disc	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc	000	000
are
either
live
performances
or
obscure
material
.

What
was
the
reasoning
behind
including
four
songs
from
a
1975
sci-fi
album
called
Flash
Fearless
Vs.
the
Zorg
Women
Parts
5
&
6
?

Three
of
the
songs
only
contain
Entwistle
on
bass
,
and
the
other
"
To
the
Chop	B	Chop	Professional_wrestling_attacks	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_attacks	000	000
"
on
which
he
does
sing
.

Entwistle	B	Entwistle	John_Entwistle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Entwistle	000	000
did
not
write
any
of
that
material
.

I
would
have
preferred
his
"
Gim
me
That
Rock
'n'
Roll
"
from
Rigor
Mortis

instead
.

The
three
best
songs
from
his
last
real
studio
solo
release
Too	B	Too Late the Hero	Too_Late_the_Hero_(album)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Late_the_Hero_(album)	000	000
Late	I	Too Late the Hero	Too_Late_the_Hero_(album)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Late_the_Hero_(album)	000	000

Hero	I	Too Late the Hero	Too_Late_the_Hero_(album)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_Late_the_Hero_(album)	000	000
are
represented
,
the
best
being
"
Talk
Dirty
To
Me
"
.

Following
that
are
a
couple
songs
from
an
attempted
project
called
The	B	The Rock	The_Rock_(John_Entwistle_album)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rock_(John_Entwistle_album)	000	000
Rock	I	The Rock	The_Rock_(John_Entwistle_album)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rock_(John_Entwistle_album)	000	000
.

This
is
around
the
time
Entwistle
stopped
singing
his
songs
.

It
became
very
noticeable
in
the
eighties
his
distinctive
nasal
tone
was
failing
him
.

While
"
Love
Does
n't
Last
"
is
n't
a
bad
song
,
it
would
have
been
much
better
with
John	B	John	John_Entwistle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Entwistle	000	000
performing
the
vocals
.

Henry
Small
,
who
does
sing
the
two
songs
from
The	B	The Rock	The_Rock_(John_Entwistle_album)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rock_(John_Entwistle_album)	000	000
Rock	I	The Rock	The_Rock_(John_Entwistle_album)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rock_(John_Entwistle_album)	000	000
,
is
a
bit
too
much
over
the
top
for
my
tastes
.

After
The
Rock

songs
,
we
get
four
live
Who
songs
performed
in
1988
by
The
John
Entwistle
Band
.

Concluding
the
anthology
is
set
of
songs
recorded
at
various
times
over
an
almost
twenty
year
period
starting
in
1978
.

They
were
released
for
an
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
TV
cartoon
series
called
Van-pires
.

While
the
songs
are
OK
,
they
are
really
nothing
more
than
a
curiosity
.

This
brings
us
to
the
question
,
to
what
purpose
does
this
anthology
serve
?

If
you
want
a
best
of
,
this
is
n't
it
.

A
good
portion
of
these
songs
are
just
here
to
represent
certain
times
in
the
timeline
.

Is
it
a
sampler
?

The
best
songs
are
off
of
the
first
three
albums
,
of
which
52
%
of
those
albums
are
represented
.

You
would
be
better
off
just
buying
those
three
.

If
you
're
a
die
hard
Entwistle
fan
,
you
've
already
got
this
stuff
,
probably
in
vinyl
and

in
one
of
the
modern
world

worst
cancer
epidemics
.

Since

have
been
scouring

Wei
County
in
southwestern
China	B	China	China	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China	000	000
for
the
smoking

and
lead
author
of
the
new
study
,
and
his
colleagues
examined
Xuan
Wei
’s
bituminous
coal
,
which
is
primarily
burned
in
household
stoves
for
heat
.

They
found
that
it
contains
a
high
concentration
of
fine-grained
silica
particles
.

“
This
was
the
first
time
that
geologists
looked
at
Xuan
Wei
’s
coal
in
detail
and
we
found
it
is
quite
unique
and
potentially
more
toxic
than
most
,
”
Large
says
.

“
Epidemiologists
have
long
suspected
the
cancer
was
linked
to
the
coal
,
but
they
did
n’t
know
why
this
particular
coal
from
this
region
was
so
toxic
.
”

“
This
study
goes
a
long
way
to
answering
our
big
question
of
‘
Why
here
?

’”
says
Robert
Chapman
,
an
epidemiologist
at
Chulalongkorn	B	Chulalongkorn University	Chulalongkorn_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chulalongkorn_University	000	000
University	I	Chulalongkorn University	Chulalongkorn_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chulalongkorn_University	000	000
in
Bangkok	B	Bangkok	Bangkok	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok	000	000
,
Thailand	B	Thailand	Thailand	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand	000	000
who
has
studied
the
Xuan
Wei
cancer
cluster
for
more
than
25
years
but
was
not
involved
in
the
new
research
.

The
study
is
not
conclusive
,
he
says
,
and
more
work
is
needed
to
establish
the
medical
link
between
the
coal
's
high
silica
content
and
this
type
of
lung
cancer
.

But
,
he
says
,
“
it
would
n’t
surprise
me
at
all
if
silica
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
bad
actors
in
Xuan
Wei
.
”

That
Xuan
Wei
’s
uniquely
toxic
coal
deposit
occurs
directly
below
the
Permian-Triassic
boundary
is
no
coincidence
,
Large
says
.

“
Here
we
have
this
very
toxic
coal
and
right
on
top
of
it
is
one
of
the
most
extreme
climatic
and
environmental
events
that
has
ever
happened
on
Earth	B	Earth	Earth	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth	000	000
,
”
he
says
.

The
massive
Siberian	B	Siberian Traps	Siberian_Traps	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Traps	000	000
Traps	I	Siberian Traps	Siberian_Traps	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Traps	000	000
volcanic
flows
that
spewed
carbon
dioxide
and
sulfur
dioxide
into
the
atmosphere
250
million
years
ago
would
have
created
a
very
acidic
atmosphere
,
which
would
have
lead
to
enhanced
weathering
of
the
solidified
lava
,
Large
says
,
including
the
Emeishan
basalt
deposits
local
to
Xuan
Wei
.

Such
weathering
would
produce
silica-rich
groundwater
that
could
have
settled
in
highly
permeable
peat
bogs
,
impregnating
the
future
coal
seam
with
silica
particles
early
in
its
diagenesis
.

The
Xuan
Wei
situation
is
something
of
a
geologic
perfect
storm
,
Large
says
.

“
As
far
as
we
know
,
this
is
the
only
place
in
the
world
where
people
are
burning
coal
from
the
Permian-Triassic
boundary
,
”
he
says
.

Furthermore
,
because
the
silica
content
is
so
high
,
the
coal
’s
carbon
and
volatile
content
is
relatively
low
,
so
people
have
to
burn
more
of
it
to
produce
adequate
heat
.

Now
that
Large
and
colleagues
have
identified
what
makes
Xuan
Wei
’s
coal
unique
,
Chapman
says
,
more
research
is
needed
from
a
medical
perspective
to
determine
whether
the
silica
is
solely
to
blame
or
whether
other
compounds
,
like
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
,
may
be
playing
a
role
as
well
.

are
conducting
a
systematic
study
,
trying
to
link
exposure
rates
to
lung
cancer
cases
in
Xuan
Wei
.

“
We
are
looking
at
all
the
possibilities
,
including
exposure
to
silica
,
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
,
heavy
metals
and
radon
,
”
says
Nathaniel
Rothman
,
a
physician
specializing
in
environmental
medicine
at
the
cancer
institute
and
an
investigator
on
the
NCI	B	NCI	National_Cancer_Institute	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute	000	000
study
.

The
NCI	B	NCI	National_Cancer_Institute	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute	000	000
study
is
an
important
step
because
while
coal
has
been
linked
to
cancers
and
other
serious
illness
for
years
,
“
we
know
surprisingly
little
about
the
number
of
components
of
coal-fire
gas
that
are
toxic
and
how
much
exposure
will
lead
to
illness
,

who

study
.

“
Every
coal
fire
is
different
and
some
produce
more
toxic
or
carcinogenic
gas
components
than
others
.
”

The
NCI	B	NCI	National_Cancer_Institute	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cancer_Institute	000	000
study
will
take
several
years
to
complete
,

This

for
me

I
’ll
be

it
to
catch
up
with
tasks
that
I
’ve
neglected
,
as
well
as
getting
prepared
for
the
next

I

be
video-conferencing
my

be

I
will
be
spending
Christmas	B	Christmas	Holiday_greetings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_greetings	000	000
at
my
home
.

My
parents
,
my
wife
’s
parents
and
her
brothers
are
coming
to
our
house
.

Last
year
we
ate
and
played
games
most
of
the
day
,
so
I
’m
thinking
this
year
will
be
more
of
the
same
.

I
have
no
plans
for
new
years
aside
from
watching
some
football
(
American
football
that
is
)
.

Greetings
to
readers
:
I
hope
everyone
has
a
great
time
with
friends
and
family
during
the
holidays
.

Try
to
take
plenty
of
time
away
from
work
and
enjoy
all
of
the
things
that
you
have
been
blessed
with
in
your
life.Chris

This
Christmas	B	Christmas	Holiday_greetings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_greetings	000	000
we
’re
hosting
a
large
family
gathering
at
our
house
.

The
conservatory
is
being
converted
into
a
dining
room
with
a
3
metre
long
table
,
nicely
decorated
with
all
kinds
of
Christmassy
objects
and
pretty
fairy
lights
surrounding
the
room
.

We
have
11
people
coming
over
including
Laura
’s
parents
,
my
parents
,
Laura
’s
brother
,
my
two
sisters
and
both
our
Grandparents
.

Following
this
is
an
evening
of
games
for
the
youngsters
and
falling
to
sleep
on
the
sofa
for
the
oldies

I
’m
trying
to
launch
a
web-design-related
project
that
I
had
in
mind
for
a
while
.

Some
days
of
the
holidays
will
include
coding
for
sure
.

For
the
rest
,
it
seems
to
be
a
snowboarding
vacation
very
close
to
where
I
live
or
a
dream-plan
which
is
going
kiteboarding
in
a
warmer
country
(
the
plain
tickets
are
currently
too
high
and
trying
to
catch
an
opportunity
)
.

All

my

I
will
spend
it
with
my

.

Holidays
are
usually
far
less
busy
than
usual
so
it
’s
a
perfect
opportunity
to
be
with
people
you
love
.

We
’ll
just
spend
a

of
time
at

coming
over.Greetings

Christmas	B	Christmas	Holiday_greetings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_greetings	000	000
has
become
more
meaningful
now
as
it
is
also
my
wedding

.

I
will
probably
reserve
a
nice
place
for
a
Christmas	B	Christmas	Holiday_greetings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_greetings	000	000
dinner
by
the

activity
that
I

is

Rather
depressingly
I
have
a
very
important
dissertation
due
after
the
Christmas	B	Christmas	Holiday_greetings	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiday_greetings	000	000
holidays
,
and
so
need
to
be
working
on
that
over
the
entire
break
.

However
,
I
’ll
also
be
spending
time
with
my
family
and
girlfriend
,
and
with
any
luck
drinking
far
too
much
.

The
good
news
is
that
despite
being
preoccupied
with
this
dissertation
I
’m
feeling
incredibly
inspired
lately
,
and
so
ca
n’t
wait
to
pour
my
efforts
into

How

I
use
to

my

specially
with
my
family
.

Wherever
I
am
,
I
back
home
and
go
for
shopping
and
dinner
.

My
Coolest
hobby
is
to
play
with
my

How
will
you
spend
your
Holidays
?

I
will
be
traveling
&
participating
in
four
different
X-Mas
’s
.

My
longtime
GF	B	GF	Cyclosarin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclosarin	000	000
and
myself
have
split
families
so
I
will
be
traveling
all
over
the
state
.

After
X-Mas
I
will
be
enjoying
a
long
break
all
the
way
through
new
years
.

Which
will
probably
consist
of
eating
,
drinking
&
working
on

70
Percent
of
Australia
Post
’s
Parcels
from
Online
Shopping

Australia	B	Australia	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
is
experiencing
consisten
growth
in
online
shopping
sales
as
evidenced
by
the
growth
in
freight
from
online
shopping
.

According
to
Australia	B	Australia	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
Posts
comments
in
an
article
in
the
Courier
mail
volumes
are
increasing
by
5-10
%
pa
.

Extract
from
the
article
”

Queensland	B	Queensland	Queensland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland	000	000
parcel
operations
manager
Seth
Grantley
said
70
percent
of
Australia	B	Australia Post	Australia_Post	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post	000	000
Post	I	Australia Post	Australia_Post	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post	000	000
’s
parcel
business
was
generated
from
online
shopping
.

“
And
this
area
is
continuing
to
grow
as
customers
increasingly
go
online
to
do
their
shopping
,
”
he
said
.

“
In
the
Brisbane	B	Brisbane	Brisbane	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane	000	000
area
,
parcel
volumes
increased
by
5
percent
over
the
past
12
months
.
”

Mr
Grantley
said
parcels
were
a
major
part
of
Australia	B	Australia Post	Australia_Post	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post	000	000
Post	I	Australia Post	Australia_Post	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post	000	000
’s
future
success
,
and
a
key
platform
of
its
business
transformation
strategy
.

“
Online
purchasing
in
Australia	B	Australia	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
is
forecast
to
grow
from
around
$
27
billion
last
year
,
to
almost
$
37
billion
by
2013
,
”
he
said
.

Slacks
Creek
’s
Ali
Norrie
believes
online
shopping
is
the
best
way
to
save
money
.

“
I
have
been
shopping
online
since
I
can
remember
,
probably
since
I
got
my
first
job
in
2004
,
”
she
said
.

“
It
was
the
price
that
attracted
me
to
online
shopping
,
items
were
always
cheaper
than
in
store
and
now
it
’s
more
about
getting
things
I
ca
n’t
find
in
store
.

Especially
outfits
,
I
can
get
something
not
many
people
have
.
”

Miss
Norrie
said
she
used
eBay	B	eBay	EBay	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay	000	000
for
purchasing
make-up
from
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
,
cheaper
than
local
stores
.

“
Usually
for
shoes
and
clothes
I
shop
around
on
different
(
web
)
sites
in
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
,
”
she
said
.

“
I
have
n’t
had
a
problem
with
sizes
,
sometimes
I
take
a
stab
in
the
dark
and
if
it
does
n’t
fit
,
I
can
give
it
to
someone
else
.
”

The
24-year-old
accounts
assistant
said
if
products
were
cheaper
in
stores
,
she
would
shop
in
retail
outlets
.

“
If
items
were
available
locally
and
at
the
same
price
,
I
would
shop
there
,
but
I
do
n’t
feel
bad
about
saving
money
,

said

Retailers
Employ
cheap
Spys

Retailers
can
now
recruit
members
of
the
public
to
spy
on
their
store
presentation
with
an
iphone
app
called
field
agent
.

Users
of
the
application
can
already
paying
shoppers
to
provide
retailers
with
in-store
intelligence
such
as
competitor
pricing
or
staff
performance
.

Its
also
a
marketing
tool
as
its
bringing
the
field
agent
into
the
store
to
complete
a
simple
task
.

Some
retailers
have
already
reported
success
and
users
say
they
use
its
GPS
system
to
find
quick
jobs
in
their
area
when
they
are
out
and
about
.

What
is
Field
Agent
?

It
’s
an
app
that
begins
with
a
Client	B	Client	Client_(computing)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)	000	000
(
who
needs
information
)
creating
a
job
requesting
specific
information
via
the
www.fieldagent.net
website
.

Field
Agent
then
reviews
and
broadcasts
a
request
to
Agents
,
(
iPhone	B	iPhone	IPhone	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone	000	000
users
in
the
field
)
who
have
installed
the
Field
Agent
App
.

Agents
use
their
iPhones
to
collect
and
return
information
and
get
paid
for
the
service
.

Payments
can
range
from
$
3
to
$
8
,
depending
on
the
job
’s
degree
of
difficulty
.

“
Now
more
than
ever
,
companies
are
looking
for
ways
to
efficiently
gain
field
intelligence
on
products
and
services
,
”

Kelly
Miller
,
Co-Founder
of
Field	B	Field Agent	Field_agent	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_agent	000	000
Agent	I	Field Agent	Field_agent	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_agent	000	000
.

“
In
an
economy
where
unemployment
is
near
record
levels
,
it
’s
rewarding
to
be
part
of
an
idea
that
can
create
income
for
thousands
of
people
.

Most
jobs
are
in
everyday
locations
where
Agents
live
.

Information
requested
by
Clients
might
include
:
retail
pricing
and
display
information
,
event
images
,
photos
of
items
for
sale
and
consumer
surveys
that
can
be
completed
anywhere
an
iPhone	B	iPhone	IPhone	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone	000	000
can
be
used
.

Field
Agent
uses
the
built-in
tools
of
the
iPhone	B	iPhone	IPhone	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone	000	000
to
provide
accurate
and
relevant
information
that
is
transmitted
back
to
Clients
.

Agent
history
,
GPS	B	GPS	Global_Positioning_System	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System	000	000
location
,
time
and
date
stamps
and
photo
confirmations
are
all
ways
to
ensure
data
is
returned
to
Clients
accurately
with
verification
.

What
’s
more
,
Clients
and
Agents
will
help
us
refine
the
many
uses
we
’ve
not
even
thought
of
,
said
Miller
.

“
We
see
a
lot
of
potential
with
this
app
,
where
Clients
will
help
us
identify
new
solutions
where
Field
Agents
can
play
a
key
role
in
delivering
data
”
.

According
to
Miller
Field
Agent
is
designed
to
have
thousands
of
Agents
ready
to
gather
information
and
offer
feedback
on
products
and
services
at
a
moment
’s
notice
.

That
is
a
powerful
business
tool
!

duboisii	I	Histoplasma duboisii	Histoplasma_duboisii	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histoplasma_duboisii	000	000
is
a
mycotic
infection
primarily
involving
cutaneous
,
liver
,
lung
,
lymphatic
,
subcutaneous
,
and
bony
tissues
.

Skin
and
bone
are
the
most
frequently
invaded
sites
[
454
]
.

The
etiologic
agent
grows
as
a
large
yeast
within
giant
cells
.

It
may
also
present
with
small
cells
that
are
typical
of
those
seen
in
histoplasmosis
due
to
Histoplasma
capsulatum
.

Nodular
and
ulcerative
cutaneous
and
osteolytic
lesions
of
bone
that
disseminate

are
the
primary
clinical
characteristics
of
histoplasmosis

Histopathology

Minimal
cellular
reaction
to
the
fungi
is
noted
with
the
exception
of
large
numbers
of
giant
cells
(
up
to
80
µm
)
and
macrophages
.

Neutrophils
are
usually
present
,
especially
during
necrosis
.

The
globose
to
ovoid
,
thick-walled
yeasts
are
7-15
µm
(
average
10
µm
)
in
diameter
and
may
form
rudimentary
pseudohyphae
consisting
of
4
or
5
cells
.

Large
aggregates
of
yeast
cells
can
be
readily
seen
within
giant
cells
and
extracellularly
following
necrosis
of
the
host
tissue

After
using
this
for
a
few
days
,
I
decided
to
Christian
Louboutin
Shoes
to
see

if
anyone
noticed
the
particularly
of
Discount
Christian

Louboutins
.

I
'm
currently
a
med
student
and
gagged
the

instant
I
put
Christian
Louboutin
Uk
Sale
on
my

face
-
it
smelled
distinctly
of
anatomy
lab
,
something
I
'd
prefer
not
to

revisit
on
a
regular
basis
.

While
Christian

Louboutin
Boots
feel
great
on
my
skin
,
and
the
smell
gets
a
little

better
over
time
,
I
would
never
buy
this
Cheap
Louboutin
Shoes
simply

due
to
the
smell
.

Whether
Christian

louboutin
Pumps
linked
to
an
unpleasant
experience
or
not
,
it
seems
that

most
find

that
although
many
of
their
products
are
now
built
in
China
they
still
use
genuine
Australian
sheepskin
so
you
get
those
great
all
season
qualities
.

Now
where
do
you
buy
Decker
Ugg
Boots
?

If
you
are
in
the
U.S.
,
a
trip
to
your
local
mall
will
get
you
a
pair
of
classic
cardies
,
talls
or
shorts
at
a
decent
price
.

So
my
daughter
wants
me
to
get
her
a
pair
of
"
ugg
boots
"
this
Christmas	B	Christmas	Christmas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas	000	000
.

I
bought
her
a
pair
of
imitation
ones
last
year
which
wore
Gianmarco
Lorenzi
Wedges
out
so
now
she
wants
the
real
deal
.

My
question
is
:
what
is
the
difference
between
egg
boots
,
emu
boots
,
bear
paw
boots
and
sheepskin
boots
?

These
are
words
that
came
up
as
I
started
to
do
my
research
...
and
I
'll
be
honest
,
before
I
spend
$
100
plus
dollars
Cheap
Christian
Louboutin
on
a
pair
of
boots
.

I
want
to
know
what
I
'm
looking
at
.

Ugg
Gianmarco
Lorenzi
Ankle
Boots
boots
...
did
you
know
that
before
the
name
was
trademarked
it
was
Aussie	B	Aussie	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
slang
for
ugly
?

Apparently
these
boots
have
been
made
for
over
200
years
in
the
land
down
under
.

Designed
to
be
worn
to
be
comfy
and
warm
...
more
function
than
fashion
.

A
closer
look
at
the
design
though
reveals
more
than
a
cozy
boot
.

In
order
to
be
Ug	B	Ug	Uganda	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda	000	000
,
Ugh
or
UGGs
they
be
made
of
100
%
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
Merino
Sheepskin
.

This
gives
the
boot
their
famous
fit
and
durability
,
soft
and
snugly
like
a
sock
but
be
tough
enough
to
worn
outdoors
.

The
next
unique
quality
of
the
Ug	B	Ug	Uganda	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda	000	000
boot
is
the
fleece
lining
.

Australians	B	Australians	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
are
said
to
have
worn
these
year
round
.

The
soft
lining
is
said
to
trap
in
body
heat
like
goose
down
in
the
cold
weather
.

Yet
,
in
the
hot
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
summers
you
Gianmarco
Lorenzi
Pumps
could
still
wear
your
ugly
boots
around
because
the
natural
fibers
pull
the
perspiration
away
from
your
body
.

I
have
to
say
these
boots
do
sound
pretty
Gianmarco
Lorenzi
Boots
cool
;
no
wonder
they
have
so
many
fans
!

Still
I
do
n't
know
what
these
trademarked
UGG
boots
are
all
about
why
are
they
so
expensive
when
the
old
genuine
ug
's
were
20
to
30
dollars
?

I
think
in
reality
it
all
comes
down
to
marketing
...

The
trade
named
UGG	B	UGG	UGG_Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UGG_Australia	000	000
boots
are
made
by
a
company
called
Decker
Outdoor
Corporation
.

Long
story
short
,
in
1971
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
surfer
registered
the
name
UGH-Boots
and
then
later
sold
he
then
sold
his
rights
to
Decker
OC
.

Decker
now
trades
in
Australia	B	Australia	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
as
UGG	B	UGG Australia	UGG_Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UGG_Australia	000	000
Australia	I	UGG Australia	UGG_Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UGG_Australia	000	000
and
has
some
of
the
original
manufacturers
building
boots
for
them
.

Now
this
next
tidbit
may
surprise
you
;
due
to
the
immense
popularity
of
the
boots
,
many
of
the
models
are
now
manufactured
in
China	B	China	China	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China	000	000
!

Kind
of
funny
a
product
that
is
synonymous
with
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
gets
bought
by
an
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
and
now
Discount
Louboutin
Pumps
gets
manufactured
in
China	B	China	China	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China	000	000
.

Decker
Outdoor
clearly
states
that
although
many
of
their
products
are
now
built
in
China	B	China	China	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China	000	000
they
still
use
genuine
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
sheepskin
so
you
get
those
great
all
season
qualities
.

Now
where
do
you
buy
Decker
Ugg
Boots
?

If
you
are
in
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
,
a
trip
to
your
local
mall
will
get
you
a
pair
of
classic
cardies
,
talls
or
shorts
at
a
decent
price
.

Head
over
to
Nordstrom	B	Nordstrom	Nordstrom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordstrom	000	000
,
Journeys
,
Macys	B	Macys	Macy's	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy's	000	000
or
Dillards	B	Dillards	Dillard's	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillard's	000	000
at
your
neighborhood
Gianmarco
Lorenzi
Shoes
mall
.

If
you
want
to
save
gas
and
time
the
online
shoe
giant
zappos.com
can
hook
you
up
with
a
pair
in
a
couple
of
days
.

So
what
about
the
Ugg	B	Ugg	UGG_Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UGG_Australia	000	000
knockoffs
that
you
see
for
less
money
?

Chances
are
the
ones
that
are
less
money
than
UGGs
are
made
of
cow
's
suede
.

Compared
to
the
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
sheepskin
there
is
no
comparison
the
sheepskin
breaths
and
keeps
your
feet
comfortable
Gianmarco
Lorenzi
in
hot
or
cold
weather
the
cheaper
product
is
just
going
to
get
sweaty
.

If
you
're
looking
for
the
true
ugly
comfort
go

Ugg
Bailey
Button
is
one
thing
that
you
must
have
in
your

this

your

They

collecting
all

necessary
things

require
from
warm
clothes
to
boots
as
all
these
are
must
.

Normal
boots
do
cover
your
feet
but
do
not
provide
them
desired
warmth
consequently
your
feet
go
numb
,
letting
you
down
and
uneasy
all
the
time
.

they
look

they
you

Trendy	B	Trendy	Fad	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fad	000	000
,
comfortable
and
affordable
are
Louboutin
On

some
features
which
make
Ugg
Christian
Louboutin
Store
Bailey

a
must
buy
.

Each
season
brings
its
own
charm
with
itself
.

If
summer
adds
color
to
your

winter
brings
love

to
it
.

So
do
not
let

Make

the
stock

As
per
my
view
,
your
winter
collection
Christian

would
remain
incomplete
if
you
do
not
have
these
boots
.

So

Past
summers
have
seen
British	B	British	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
holidaymakers
frantically
searching
for
foreign
beach
holiday
deals
year
after
year
.

This
overseas
holiday
trend
has
been
growing
at
an
average
rate
of
4
%
per
year
over
the
past
25
years
,
with
tourists
heading
to
the
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
from
overseas
growing
at
an
average
of
3.2
%
.

(
ONS	B	ONS	National_Office_of_Statistics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Office_of_Statistics	000	000
)
reported
that
this
trend
changed
in
2009
,
with
58.6
million
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
holidaymakers
heading
overseas
,
a
15
%
drop
on
2008
.

Overseas
residents
heading
to
the
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
on
holiday
also
fell
from
31.9
million
in
2008
to
29.9
million
in
2009
,
a
slower
drop
of
6.3
%
.

Surprisingly
this
drop
is
not
exclusive
to
holidaymakers
cutting
back
on
their
beach
holiday
deals
abroad
.

In
fact
business
visits
were
the
hardest
hit
,
falling
by
23
%
among
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
residents
travelling
abroad
on
business
,
compared
to
19
%
of
overseas
business
travellers
heading
here
to
the
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
.

Holiday
visits
to
relatives
abroad
by
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
residents
fell
at
a
lower
rate
of
6.5
%
and
to
friends
abroad
at
a
higher
15
%
.

The
number
of
overseas
residents
visiting
the
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
to
see
friends
and
family
also
dropped
by
9.7
%
.

ONS	B	ONS	National_Office_of_Statistics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Office_of_Statistics	000	000
reported
that
it
is
not
all
doom
and
gloom
for
some
sectors
of
the
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
though
,
as
expenditure
of
overseas
visitors
during
their
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
holidays
grew
from
#
16.3
billion
in
2008
to
#
16.6
billion
last
year
in
2009
,
with
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
residents
’
expenditure
abroad
falling
by
#
5.1
billion
due
to
the
current
economic
climate
.

The
number
of
overseas
travellers
visiting
London	B	London	London	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London	000	000
during
their
stay
here
fell
by
3.7
%
in
2009
,
with
visits
to
Scotland	B	Scotland	Scotland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland	000	000
rising
slightly
during
this
time
.

Edinburgh	B	Edinburgh	Edinburgh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh	000	000
,
Manchester	B	Manchester	Manchester	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester	000	000
and
Birmingham	B	Birmingham	Birmingham	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham	000	000
remain
popular
destinations
for
overseas
visitors
to
the
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
.

The
most
common
reason
for
British	B	British	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
residents
travelling
abroad
is
still
for
annual
holidays
.

They
also
dominate
spending
with
#
21.8
billion
of
the
#
31.7
billion
total
expenditure
abroad
in
2009
being
for
holiday
purposes
.

Throughout
2009
Egypt	B	Egypt	Egypt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt	000	000
,
Jamaica	B	Jamaica	Jamaica	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica	000	000
and
Lithuania	B	Lithuania	Lithuania	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania	000	000
received
an
increase
in
visits
from
UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
residents
,
continuing
the
overall
trend
in
recent
years
.

Mexico	B	Mexico	Mexico	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico	000	000
was
exempt
from
this
increase
as
visitors
there
dropped
substantially
by
41
%
.

UK	B	UK	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
residents
may
be
taking
fewer
beach
holidays
abroad
but
there
has
been
a
rise
in
the
duration
of
holidays
in
recent
years
.

In
2007
the
average
stay
was
9.9
nights
rising
to
10.2
nights
in
2008
and
even
further
to
10.5
nights
in
2009
.

This
shows
that
although
holidaymakers
are
cutting
back
on
the
amount
of
foreign
trips
they
are
taking
,
many
are
making
up
for
this
by
increasing
the
time
that
they
spend
away
on
holiday
.

Georgia	B	Georgia	Georgia_(country)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)	000	000
--
After
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
at
sea
as
a
hostage
held
by
Somali	B	Somali	Somalia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia	000	000
pirates
,
Memed
Zakaradze
is
relieved
to
know
his
grandchildren
in
this
Georgian	B	Georgian	Georgia_(country)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)	000	000
port
city
still
recognize
him
.
"

They
've
grown
up
in
my
absence
,
"
the
63-year-old
Zakaradze
says
ruefully
.
"

But
they
still
remember
me
.
"

In
September
2010
,
Zakaradze
was
captaining
a
run-down
tanker
,
the
"
Olib
G
,
"
through
the
perilous
Gulf	B	Gulf of Aden	Gulf_of_Aden	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden	000	000
of	I	Gulf of Aden	Gulf_of_Aden	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden	000	000
Aden	I	Gulf of Aden	Gulf_of_Aden	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden	000	000
when
his
ship
was
approached
by
a
ship
manned
by
armed
Somali	B	Somali	Somalia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia	000	000
pirates
.
"

We
called
for
patrolling
ships
,
"
says
Zakaradze
.
"

But
meanwhile
,
the
vessel
approached
us
and
one
of
the
pirates
managed
to
come
onboard
our
ship
.

As
soon
as
he
got
on
,
he
started
shooting
.

The
others
followed
suit
.

They
gathered
us
together
on
the
captain
's
deck
.

In
five
minutes
,
a
military
ship
and
a
helicopter
arrived
,
but
it
was
too
late
already
.

Nothing
could
be
done
.
"

No
Way
Out

Held
at
gunpoint
,
Zakaradze
and
his
crew
members
--
14
Georgians	B	Georgians	Georgia_(country)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)	000	000
and
three
Turks	B	Turks	Turkey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey	000	000
--
were
forced
to
turn
the
"
Olib
G
"
around
and
drop
anchor
off
the
Somali	B	Somali	Somalia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia	000	000
coast
.

There
,
the
sailors
spent
the
next
16
months
enduring
searing
heat
and
brutal
abuse
at
the
hands
of
their
Somali	B	Somali	Somalia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia	000	000
captors
,
who
demanded
$
9
million
in
ransom
.

Zakaradze
's
experience
,
recounted
to
RFE/RL	B	RFE/RL	Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty	000	000
's
Georgian
Service
in
its
"
Liberty
Diaries
"
program
,
provides
a
rare
glimpse
into
what
the
captain
himself
calls
the
"
infernal
torment
"
of
life
on
a
pirate
ship
.
"

They
treated
us
very
mercilessly
,
extremely
mercilessly
,
"
he
says
.
"

Kept
us
chained
together
like
dogs
,
for
eight
months
.

We
had
no
food
,
no
water
,
and
no
access
to
the
toilet
for
56
hours
at
a
time
.

Some
days
were
even
worse
.

Once
they
brought
in
bottles
of
urine
,
poured
it
over
us
,
then
coated
us
with
flour
.

They
left
us
like
that
for
24
hours
.
"

Stranded
At
Sea

Zakaradze
had
nowhere
to
turn
for
help
.

The
Greek	B	Greek	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
company
that
owned
the
"
Olib
G
"
had
gone
bankrupt
.

Repeated
calls
to
the
owners
went
unanswered
.

And
the
vessel
itself
was
about
to
be
scrapped
,
so
there
was
no
chance
of
exchanging
the
ship
for
their
release
.

The
case
is
strikingly
similar
to
that
of
another
Georgian	B	Georgian	Georgia_(country)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)	000	000
cargo
ship
,
the
"
Vasilios
N
,
"
which
was
stranded
for
nearly
a
year
in
the
Libyan	B	Libyan	Libya	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya	000	000
port
of
Misurata	B	Misurata	Misrata	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misrata	000	000
when
its
Greek	B	Greek	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
and
Italian	B	Italian	Italy	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy	000	000
owners
abandoned
the
craft
and
its
debts
.

As
the
months
went
by
,
Zakaradze
says
,
life
on
board
the
"
Olib
G
"
became
increasingly
desperate
.
"

The
[
pirates
'
]
lawyer
,
or
translator
,
would
come
on
board
the
ship
,
"
he
says
.
"

Since
our
efforts
to
reach
the
ship
's
owner
had
failed
,
they
started
asking
us
to
call
home
and
ask
our
family
members
to
organize
rallies
,
so
that
our
government
would
[
feel
compelled
to
]
pay
them
.

,
particularly
in
the
narrow
Gulf	B	Gulf	Gulf_of_Aden	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden	000	000
corridor
,
which
some
21,000
ships
pass
through
each
year
.

Hostage-taking
has
become
so
profitable
that
many
Somali	B	Somali	Somalia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia	000	000
pirates
are
eager
to
publicize
the
suffering
of
their
captives
in
order
to
ensure
ransom
demands
are
met
.

A
blurry
video
released
to
the
media
a
full
year
after
their
capture
showed
the
"
Olib
G
"
crew
looking
gaunt
and
weary
.

Zakaradze
says
now
there
were
many
occasions
when
he
and
his
crew
were
close
to
death
.
"

For
16
months
,
all
we
ate
was
pasta
and
rice
,
boiled
in
salted
water
,
"
he
says
.
"

Our
families
were
more
or
less
aware
of
our
condition
,
but
we
kept
many
things
secret
from
them
.

For
instance
,
I
did
n't
reveal
until
I
got
back
what
they
were
doing
to
me
.

I
was
stripped
from
the
waist
up
and
tied
to
the
stern
of
the
ship
,
forced
to
stay
like
this
for
eight
hours
under
open
sky
,
in
100-degree
heat
.
"
"

I
was
the
eldest
on
the
ship
,
"
Zakaradze
adds
.
"

So
they
probably
thought
I
was
going
to
die
and
that
that
would
speed
things
up
[
with
the
ransom
deal
]
.
"

Home
,
But
Still
Healing

In
the
end
,
the
Georgian	B	Georgian	Georgia_(country)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)	000	000
government
intervened
,
finally
securing
the
release
of
the
Georgian	B	Georgian	Georgia_(country)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)	000	000
and
Turkish	B	Turkish	Turkey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey	000	000
"
Olib
B
"
sailors
this
month
.

Somali	B	Somali	Somalia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia	000	000
media
reported
that
a
$
3
million
ransom
was
paid
for
the
men
's
'
release
,
but
Georgian	B	Georgian	Georgia_(country)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)	000	000
officials
deny
any
money
changed
hands
.

Zakaradze
himself
says
he
's
not
sure
what
finally
brought
his
crew
's
torment
to
an
end
,
but
credits
his
men
with
never
losing
hope
.

But
now
,
back
in
Batumi	B	Batumi	Batumi	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batumi	000	000
,
Zakaradze
is
grappling
with
the
consequences
of
his
ordeal
.

His
eyesight
and
hearing
are
failing
and
his
face
looks
permanently
worn
.

Even
the
winter
snow
has
proven
hard
to
take
.
"

After
the
heat
of
Somalia	B	Somalia	Somalia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia	000	000
,
Batumi	B	Batumi	Batumi	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batumi	000	000

hard
for
me

"
the
captain
says
in
a
tired
voice
.
"

I
find
it
difficult
to
be
in

Study
of
weather
changes
is
constantBy
Donal
Hickey
Monday
,
February
21
,
2011
Irish	B	Irish	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
people
’s
obsession
with
the
weather
,
and
what
‘
it
’s
going
to
do
’
,
is
not

unique.Many
of
the
signs
on
which
traditional
weather
prediction
has
always
been
based

are
also
talked
about
in
other
parts
of
the
world
.

Even
though
the
land
and
climate
in
both
countries
are
very
different
,
the
weather-conscious
Irish	B	Irish	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
farmer
has
,
for
example
,
much
in
common
with
,
say
,
a
fellow
farmer
in
Greece	B	Greece	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
.

For
thousands
of
years
before
Jean
Byrne
,
or
Martin	B	Martin King	Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.	000	000
King	I	Martin King	Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.	000	000
,
came
on
the
television
each
night
to
give
us
scientific
forecasts
,
people
looked
to
the
sky
,
plants
,
and
animals
for
indications
of
what
the
morrow
would
bring
.

Indeed
,
there
’s
a
striking
similarity
in
the
signs
on
which
amateur
meteorologists
of
old
,
around
the
world
,
based
their
predictions
.

This
is
borne
out
by
retired
UCC	B	UCC	University_College_Cork	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_Cork	000	000
classics
lecturer
,
Dr
Patrick
Cronin
,
in
a
newly-published
study
spanning
3,000
years
.

The
scholarly
tome
sets
out
the
attempts
made
by
the
Greeks	B	Greeks	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
to
predict
weather
change
by
naked-eye
observation
of
signs
from
the
sky
,
unaided
by
scientific
meteorology
.

Knowledge
of
weather
lore
gained
while
growing
up
on
a
farm
in
Sliabh	B	Sliabh Luachra	Sliabh_Luachra	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliabh_Luachra	000	000
Luachra	I	Sliabh Luachra	Sliabh_Luachra	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliabh_Luachra	000	000
,
close
to
the
Cork	B	Cork	County_Cork	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Cork	000	000
/
Kerry	B	Kerry	County_Kerry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kerry	000	000
border
,
was
fundamental
in
Dr
Cronin
’s
later
study
of
how
the
Greeks	B	Greeks	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
went
about
it
.

Much
of
his
seminal
knowledge
was
gleaned
from
his
father
while
they
saved
hay
or
worked
in
the
bog
together
,
or
while
observing
the
fire
on
the
hearth
with
his
mother
.

This
is
acknowledged
in
the
book
’s
dedication
,
which
reads
:
‘
To
the
memory
of
my
father
,
who
taught
me
to
read
the
wind
.
’

In
a
foreword
,
TCD	B	TCD	Trinity_College,_Dublin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College,_Dublin	000	000
Emeritus
Professor
George
Huxley
describes
Dr
Cronin
as
a
scholar
by
vocation
and
a
countryman
at
heart
.

He
has
combined
his
boyhood
insights
with
his
knowledge
of
the
Greek	B	Greek	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
language
.

But
his
rural
upbringing
helped
him
in
another
way
--
while
the
greater
part
of
his
research
was
carried
out
at
his
desk
and
in
academic
libraries
,
he
could
easily
identify
with
the
old
people
he
interviewed
in
the
Greek	B	Greek	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
countryside
.

It
was
from
farmers
,
shepherds
,
and
sailors
that
he
learned
a
deal
about
Greek	B	Greek	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
weather
lore
.

His
book
contains
a
catalogue
of

720
signs
derived
from
clouds
,
comets
,
dew
,
frost
,
mist
,
moon
,
winds
and
many
other
natural
phenomena
.

The
crucial
importance
of
the
weather
for
agriculture
is
recognised
in
an
ancient
Greek	B	Greek	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
proverb
with
a
universal
application
--
it
is
the
seasons
,
not
the
soil
,
that
bear
crops
.

Most
of
the
predictions
in
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
and
Greece	B	Greece	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
are
based
on
observation
of
birds
,
animals
,
insects
and
fish
,
the
sun
and
the
moon
.

The
Greeks	B	Greeks	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
,
however
,
use
far
more
signs
from
animals
and
the
sky
than
we
do
,
though
some
signs
are
common
to
both
countries
.

One
is
that
gulls
fly
in
from
the
sea
before
a
storm
,
often
referred
to
by
people
in
Cork	B	Cork	County_Cork	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Cork	000	000
,
Kerry	B	Kerry	County_Kerry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kerry	000	000
,
Donegal	B	Donegal	Donegal_GAA	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donegal_GAA	000	000
and
Tipperary	B	Tipperary	Tipperary_GAA	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipperary_GAA	000	000
.

Another
is
that
streaks
of
light
beneath
the
sun
are
a
sign
of
bad
weather
--
found
in
the
folk
traditions
of
the
Blasket
islands
,
and
other
areas
along
the
west	B	west coast	West_Coast_of_the_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States	000	000
coast	I	west coast	West_Coast_of_the_United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States	000	000
.

Dr
Cronin
grew
up
in
a
place
with
a
lyrical
name
that
would
have
been
familiar
to
the
great
Gaelic	B	Gaelic	Scottish_Gaelic	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic	000	000
poets
,
Eoghan
Ruadh
Ó
Suilleabhain
and
Aogan
Ó
Rathaille
,
who
hailed
from
the
area
.

It
’s
called
Magha
an
tSamhraidh
(
summer
pasture
)
,
not
far
from
the
Paps
Mountains
.

People
in
the
area
would
look
towards
the
Paps	B	Paps	Breast	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast	000	000
,
and
other
mountains
,
for
weather
indications
from
the
presence
of
cloud
,
clarity
of
the
atmosphere
and
other
observations
.

Low
clouds
on
the
mountains
are
seen
as
a
sure
sign
of
approaching
rain
.

Other
mountains
mentioned
by
him
include
Clara
and
Muisire
,
in
Co	B	Co Cork	County_Cork	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Cork	000	000
Cork	I	Co Cork	County_Cork	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Cork	000	000
,
and
Cnoc
Firinne
,
near
Ballingarry	B	Ballingarry	Ballingarry,_County_Limerick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballingarry,_County_Limerick	000	000
,
in
Co	B	Co Limerick	County_Limerick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Limerick	000	000
Limerick	I	Co Limerick	County_Limerick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Limerick	000	000
.

Translated	B	Translated	Translation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation	000	000
,
Cnoc
Firinne
means
hill
of
truth
,
believed
to
be
so
named
because
of
the
accurate
weather
indications
it
rendered
farmers
through
the
centuries
.

The
sudden
appearance
of
thousands
of
ants
on
a
road
in
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
has
always
been
regarded
as
a
portent
of
rain
.

The
ancient
Greeks	B	Greeks	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
also
used
this
weather
sign
.

And
Dr
Cronin
believes
that
faith
placed
in
ants
as
weather
prophets
is
justified
.

Ants
,
he
says
,
have
a
high
sensitivity
to
atmospheric
change
and
can
anticipate
rain
sooner
than
man
.

Another
belief
common
to
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
,
Greece	B	Greece	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
,
and
many
other
countries
is
that
if
swallows
fly
low
it
is
a
sign
of
rain
.

This
sign
is
reliable
,
he
remarks
.

Swallows
are
able
to
catch
insects
at
high
levels
in
fine
weather
,
but
when
the
atmosphere
is
very
humid
,
just
prior
to
rain
,
insects
remain
near
ground
level
so
that
swallows
descend
in
pursuit
.

Not
all
the
old
signs
could
be
trusted
,
but
people
all
over
the
world
have
benefited
over
millennia
from
the
wisdom
of
weather
lore
.

Robert	B	Robert Mizrachi	Robert_Mizrachi	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mizrachi	000	000
Mizrachi	I	Robert Mizrachi	Robert_Mizrachi	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mizrachi	000	000
is
the
unofficial
chip
leader
at
the

Vegas	I	Las Vegas	Las_Vegas_Strip	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip	000	000
.

The
exact
chip
counts
have
yet
to
be
correlated
,
but
it
is
thought
that
he
is
currently
in
the
number
one
position
with
523,200
.

Bryan

is
likely
second
with

Mortensen	I	Carlos Mortensen	Carlos_Mortensen	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Mortensen	000	000
(
371,600
)
.

The
field
was
cut
down
to
200
players
during
day
two
,
which
saw
perhaps
the
greatest
number
of
stars
eliminated
in
tournament
history
.

Approximately
a
dozen
more
major
titlists
were
also
knocked
out
,
with
many
more
surviving
,
including

(
DSC	B	DSC	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
)
has
been

widely

(

)
but
is

usually
(
mis
)
used
at
temperatures
above
the

of

Many

emit
light
(
chemiluminescence
,
CL	B	CL	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
)
during

.

CL	B	CL	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
offers
an
alternative
method
to
monitor
oxidation
,

its
advantage
being
very
high
sensitivity
.

CL	B	CL	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
imaging
of

oxidative
degradation
has
recently
been
made
possible
by
the

development
of
low
noise
,
high
sensitivity
cameras
,
which
allow

multiple
sampling
,
reducing
experimental
times
and
cost
.

Imaging

also
allows
study
of
inhomogeneity
.

In
collaboration
with
Mettler

,
we
have
combined
CL

measurement
with
DSC	B	DSC	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
in
a
single
instrument
.

The
combination
has

obvious
advantages
where
oxidation
occurs
simultaneously
with

other
thermal
events
,
e.g.
melting
,
since
the
CL	B	CL	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
is
sensitive

only
to
oxidation
.

CL	B	CL	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
in
inert

can
easily
detect
the

presence
of

at
concentrations
well
below
those

detectable
by
DSC	B	DSC	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
.

Measurements

show

good

of
CL	B	CL	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
with

with

consistent
with
the
Russell
mechanism
for
CL	B	CL	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
.

Studies
of
the

formation
of
carbonyl

show
that
the
relation
of

to
C	B	C =O	Carbonyl	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl	000	000
=O	I	C =O	Carbonyl	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonyl	000	000

content
is
also
consistent

.

For

OITs
measured

The
modifications
of
structure
and
properties
of
polymeric

materials
resulting
of
the
ageing
initiated
by
ionising

radiations
have
been
a
subject
of
interest
as
soon
as
nuclear

programs
began
.

Exposure
of
polymers
to
radiative
environments

causes
indeed
a
deterioration
of
their
properties
.

It
has
been

approximately
50
years
since
researchers
first
began
studying
the

effects
of
ionising
radiations
on
polymers
.

The
main

radiation-induced
changes
consist
in
scissions
and/or

crosslinking
of
the
macromolecular
chains
,
formation
of
gaseous

products
such
as
hydrogen
or
low
molecular
weight
hydrocarbons
,

accumulation
of
oxidation
products
,
loss
and/or
formation
of

unsaturations
.

Among
the
numerous
studies
devoted
to
the
radiochemical
ageing

of
polymers
,
many
of
them
report
on
the
mechanism
of
the
-
initiated
degradation
of
polyolefins
.

This
presentation
concerns
the
behaviour
of
EPDM	B	EPDM	EPDM_rubber	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPDM_rubber	000	000
copolymers
,

which
are
composed
of
ethylene
(
PE	B	PE	Polyethylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene	000	000
)
,
propylene
(
PP	B	PP	Polypropylene	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypropylene	000	000
)
and
diene

monomer
(
5-ethylidene
2-norbornene
(
ENB
)
in
this
study
)
.

These

polymers
find
numerous
applications
and
are
often
used
as
wire

insulators
or
joints
.

If
the
mechanisms
of
photo
-
and

thermo-oxidations
of
EPDM	B	EPDM	EPDM_rubber	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPDM_rubber	000	000
can
be
considered
as
well
known
,
the

radiation
induced
degradation
of
these
polymers
has
only
received

little
attention
.

On
the
basis
of
a
recent
study
involving
the
identification
of

the
various
products
that
are
formed
,
a
mechanism
accounting
for

the
radiochemical
degradation
of
EPDM
has
been
proposed
,
with
a

peculiar
attention
given
to
the
role
played
by
oxygen
and
by
the

ENB
termonomer
.

Two
main
processes
are
involved
in
the

radiooxidation
of
EPDM
.

The
random
-
radiolysis

of
the
polymer
provides
a
constant
source
of
macroalkyl
radicals

mainly
formed
on
ethylene
units
.

The
secondary
radicals
so
formed

are
likely
to
initiate
a
selective
oxidation
of
the
polymer

through
free-radicals
reactions
involving
the
abstraction
of

labile
hydrogen
atoms
.

In
particular
,
the
decomposition
of

hydroperoxydes
and
the
degradation
of
the
ENB
moieties
,
this

latter
being
the
most
oxidisable
site
and
the
source
of

crosslinking
,
may
result
from
hydrogen
abstraction
by
radicalar

species

OVERVIEW
AND
PARTICULARITIES
IN
DEGRADATION
OF
POLYOLEFINS

DERIVED
FROM
FISCHER-TROPSCH
SYNTHESIS

Polyolefins
are
without
doubt
the
largest
volume
family
of

commercially
polymers
and
a
vast
literature
is
dedicated
to
this

field
in
the
last
half
of
century
.

The
most
complex
pool
of

monomers
is
available
from
the
Fischer
Tropsch
process
that
is

gaining
momentum
as
a
major
market
source
.

When
compared
with

ethylene
oligomerization
processes
the
main
advantage
of
the

Fischer
Tropsch
process
is
the
production
of
odd
carbon
number

linear
and
branched
olefins
that
showed
new
application

possibilities
in
both
the
polyethylene
and
polypropylene

families
.

We
prepared
a
large
number
of
new
polyolefins
with

Fischer
Tropsch
derived
alpha
olefins
that
have
particular

microstructures
and
morphology
according
to
the
type
of
branch
,

length
of
branch
and
number
of
branches
/
1000
carbons
.

It
is
known
that
steric
factors
may
play
an
important
role
in

polyolefin
degradation
and
that
tertiary
carbon
is
labile
to

oxidative
attack
.

A
decrease
in
crystallinity
with
the
increase

of
comonomer
content
may
favour
auto-oxidation
due
to
higher

oxygen
absorbtion
.

Very
little
literature
on
degradation
of

polyolefins
prepared
with
Fisher
Tropsch
derived
olefins
is

available
.

In
this
paper
is
presented
and
discussed
some

particularities
on
the
degradation
of
polyolefins
Fischer
Tropsch

derived
.

The
manifestation
of
oxidation
weather
by
temperature
or
aging

concerning
polymer
appearance
as
discoloration
,
loss
of
optical

properties
,
loss
of
mechanical
properties
and
surface
cracks
were

observed
.

This
behaviour
was
similar
to
known
polyolefins
.

Oxidation
induction
time
as
measured
by
DSC	B	DSC	Differential_scanning_calorimetry	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_scanning_calorimetry	000	000
varies
with
the

number
of
branch
and
length
of
branch
introduced
in
the
polymer

chain
by
a
certain
comonomer
.

The
thermal
stability
was
measured

also
by
thermogravimetry
and
compared
with
the
polymer
structure

and
thermal
behaviour
.

The
degradation
temperature
increases
with

an
increase
of
carbon
number
of
the
comonomer
.

Investigation
for

a
series
of
ethylene
co-polymers
and
ter-polymers
with
linear
and

branched
alpha
olefins
showed
an
increase
of
pre-exponential

factor
as
a
function
of
carbon
number
in
an
Arrhenius
type

equation
.

A
decomposition
kinetic
study
showed
that
the

activation
and
the
rate
constant
is
also
related
to
the
size
and

type
of
branch
.

Rheological
investigation
showed
a
similar

pattern
.

It
was
concluded
that
while
polyolefins
obtained
with

Fischer
Tropsch
derived
olefins
showed
a
behaviour
similar
with

known
polyolefins
,
particularities
in
degradation
does
exist
and

are
related
to
the
number
and
type
of
branch
.

practice
the
levels

achieved
on
an
industrial
scale
with
post-consumer
plastics
can

be
viewed
as
disappointingly
low
.

In
addition
to
economic

considerations
,
this
is
because
there
are
a
limited
number
of

applications
allowing
closed
loop
recycling
and
there
is
a

mismatch
between
the
supply
of
recyclate
and
demand
from
the

market
.

New
developments
will
increase
the
potential
,
but
such

recycling
will
nevertheless
remain
limited
.

Feedstock
recycling
technologies
offer
versatility
and
many

large
scale
processes
have
been
developed
and
demonstrated
.

Logistics
and
supply
commitments
are
key
factors
in
determining

viability
.

To
date
,
fully
commercial
plants
are
only
operational

in
Germany	B	Germany	Germany	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany	000	000
and
Japan	B	Japan	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000
.

A
number
of
active
developments
are
,

however
,
currently
underway
in
a
number
of
European	B	European	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
countries
.

Energy
recovery
will
become
an
increasingly
important
recovery

option
as
it
is
also
being
stimulated
by
restrictions
on
the

landfilling
of
waste
.

Even
if
the
full
potential
of
mechanical

recycling
were
to
be
realized
,
the
major
part
of
total
plastics

waste
would
still
be
available
for
use
as
an
alternative
fuel
.

This
means
that
with
the
expected
growth
of
plastics
,
this

represents
an
increasingly
important
source
of
energy
,
equivalent

to
millions
of
tonnes
of
imported
oil
each
year
.

The
challenge
for
the
successful
recovery
of
plastics
is
to

identify
and
use
the
optimum
combination
of
options
,
underpinned

by
continuing
innovation
in
process
,
product
and
recovery

technologies
in
order
to
increase
the
resource
efficiency
of

products
throughout

OPTIMISAZION
OF
PROCESSING
CONDITIONS
IN
THE
RECYCLING
OF

POLYCONDENSATION
POLYMERS

Mechanical
recycling
of
polymers
is
a
very
complex
and

difficult
process
because
repetitive
melt
processing
can
lead
to

severe
degradation
of
these
materials
with
subsequent

deterioration
of
all
the
properties
.

For
condensation
polymers
,

the
degradation
rate
is
much
faster
in
the
presence
of
water
that

induces
depolymerization
reactions
,
having
also
a
synergistic

effect
with
thermomechanical
degradation
and
exalting
the
loss
of

properties
.

Indeed
,
a
careful
drying
prior
to
processing
can

drastically
reduce
the
degradation
phenomena
but
increasing
the

complexity
of
the
process
and
its
cost
.

The
aim
of
this
work
is
to
study
the
effect
of
the

reprocessing
of
some
polycondensation
polymers
with
and
in

absence
of
water
.

Moreover
,
the
possibility
to
process
wet

polymer
in
the
presence
of
proper
stabilisers
to
avoid
the
drying

step
has
been
studied
too
.

The
materials
chosen
for
the
study
have
been
polyamide
6
,

polycarbonate
and
polyethyleneterephtalate
.

The
results
indicate
that
for
the
three
different
systems

considered
,
the
wet
processing
causes
,
as
expected
,
a
strong

reduction
of
the
mechanical
properties
and
of
the
molecular

weight
,
as
evidenced
by
rheological
and
thermal
measurements
.

If
a
degassing
stage
is
added
to
the
processing
apparatus
,
a

certain
improvement
of
the
properties
is
observed
.

This
can
be

explained
in
terms
of
humidity
removing
with
consequent
reduction

of
the
hydrolytic
chain
scission
.

When
nitrogen
flow
is
added
to
the
degassing
,
both
humidity

and
oxygen
are
practically
eliminated
from
the
system
,
and
a

further
improvement
of
the
properties
is
observed
.

This
can
be

explained
with
the
further
reduction
of
the
humidity
but
it
also

suggests
that
degradation
mechanism
involves
reactions
.

The
presence
small
amounts
(
500
ppm
)
of
a
particular

antioxidant
has
a
positive
effect
in
all
the
cases
.

In

particular
,
the
adding
of
antioxidant
can
substitute
the
drying

stage
as
it
is
able
to
protect
the
macromolecules
from

hydrolysis
.

This
behaviour
can
be
explained
considering
that
this

antioxidant
is
more
prone
to
hydrolysis
than
the
polymer
,
thus

removing
the
water
from
the
melt
and
decreasing
the
degradation

rate
.

Such
consideration
has
been
proved
using
different

antioxidants
with
different
tendency
to
hydrolysis
:
using

antioxidants
with
theoretical
reduced
hydrolysis
tendency
caused

a
parallel
reduction
of
the
protection
with
consequent
loss
of

properties
.

The
positive
effect
of
the
presence
of
the
antioxidant
has

been
also
verified
for
several
reprocessing
steps
(
up
to
five
)
.

The
results
indicate
that
the
presence
of
the
antioxidant
still

have
positive
effects
also
after
several
recycling
operation
.

It
can
be
concluded
that
the
mechanical
recycling
of

condensation
polymers
can
be
effectuated
with
practically
any

loss
of
properties
if
an
adequate
removal
of
humidity
from
the

system
is
performed
.

A
valid
alternative
to
the
complex
and

expensive
pre-drying
operation
can
be
the
adding
of
antioxidants

that
undergo
hydrolysis
in
vice
of
the
polymers
.

.

Separated
PET
bottles
are

now
used
as
raw
material
for
polyester
fibers
,
30,000
t/y
in

capacity
from
April
,
2002
,
and
the
two
commercial
plants
for
the

Bottle
to
Bottle
recycling
are
under
construction
for
the
first

time
in
the
world
.

Clearly
this
is
related
to
the
practical
implementation
of
the

Containers
and
Packaging
Recycling
Law
carried
out
in
1997
for

PET
bottles
and
in
2000
for
the
other
plastics
.

This
law
affords

allocating
the
cost
for
feedstock
recycling
of
waste
plastics

separated
only
in
homes
.

It
has
created
attractive
markets
and

thus
,
they
say
that
the
separated
waste
plastics
are
even
in

short
supply
in
Japan	B	Japan	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000
.

Recovery

bottles	I	PET bottles	Polyethylene_terephthalate	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate	000	000
increases

successfully
since
1997
,
but
that
of
plastics
increases

dramatically
since
2000
when
the
law
has
carried
out
.

On
the
other
hand
,
their
cost
for
recycling
decreases

gradually
.

At
present
,
their
recycling
fees
are
quite
expensive

compared
to
the
cost
for
treatment
of
industrial
waste
plastics
.

However
,
it
is
expected
that
the
cost
will
continue
to
drop
.

This

trend
suggests
that
the
active
competitions
among
various

techniques
proceed
including
the
improvement
of
collection

system
.

This
situation
creates
big
chances
for
the
world

recycling
technologies
in
the
Japanese	B	Japanese	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000
market
and
refine

necessarily
both
techniques
and
logistic
systems
.

The
Home
Appliances
Recycling
Law
came
into
full
force
in

April
2001
is
to
be
revised
within
a
few
years
.

In
such
process
,

they
say
,
not
only
the
recycling
of
their
plastics
cases
,
but

also
that
of
printed
circuit
boards
are
introduced
to
elevate
the

recycling
degree
.

In
addition
,
the
Law
for
Recycling
of
End-of-Life
Vehicles
has

passed
through
the
Parliament	B	Parliament	Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom	000	000
,
July
2002
.

They
say
,
an
average

cost
per
car
will
be
20,000
Yen
,
namely
151Euro
.

Clearly
this
law

should
proceed
the
recycling
of
automotive
shredder
residue
.

These
environmental
policy
of
Japanese	B	Japanese	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000
Government
are
sure
to

promote
more
the
recycling
of
waste
plastics
in
Japan	B	Japan	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000

to
do
with
the
long-term
quality
of
the
program
and
trying
to
build
“
the
values
and
standards
that
you
want
your
team
to
represent
.
”

He
has
n’t
elaborated
on
the
reasons
for
the
suspensions
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
declined
to
say
if
the
violations
of
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
and
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
were
more
serious
,
but
reiterated
that
their
suspension
remained
indefinite
.

“
I
do
n’t
want
to
get
into
that
,
that
’s
just
the
way
it
is
right
now
,
”
he
said.This
is
the
third
time
Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
has
suspended
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
,
a
first-team
All
-
SEC	B	SEC	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
player
,
during
his
three
seasons
,
including
a
three-game
string
early
last
season
and
one
game
at
the
end
of
2009-10
.

Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
did
n’t
rule
it
out
when
asked
if
he
had
a
“
three-strike
”
policy
that
might
keep
Green	B	Green	JaMychal_Green	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JaMychal_Green	000	000
from
returning
.

“
I
’ll
make
some
decisions
on
that
later
,
”
he
said
.

“
Right
now
my
focus
is
on
getting
prepared
for
Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
.
”

Alabama
had
risen
to
No.
12
in
the
rankings
in
December
and
won
three
straight
before
the
LSU	B	LSU	LSU_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football	000	000
game.The
bold
decision
on
the
suspensions
was
no
surprise
to
Gators
coach
Billy	B	Billy Donovan	Billy_Donovan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan	000	000
Donovan	I	Billy Donovan	Billy_Donovan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan	000	000
,
who
was
Grant	B	Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
’s
boss
for
a
dozen
years
at
Marshall	B	Marshall	Marshall_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_University	000	000
and
Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
.

“
I
know
Anthony	B	Anthony Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
Grant	I	Anthony Grant	Anthony_Grant	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Grant	000	000
about
as
well
as
anybody
,
and
I
think
that
he
has
got
incredible
integrity
and
character
and
knows
exactly
the
way
he
wants
his
program
run
and
what
he
’s
going
to
do
,
”
Donovan	B	Donovan	Billy_Donovan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Donovan	000	000
said.The
Tide
’s
eight
remaining
players
--
half
of
them
freshmen
--
managed
to
come
fairly
close
before
losing
67-58
to
LSU	B	LSU	LSU_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football	000	000
,
with
freshman
Rodney
Cooper
scoring
28
points
.

Alabama
had
beaten
Auburn	B	Auburn	Auburn_Tigers_football	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_Tigers_football	000	000
by
18
points
without
Mitchell	B	Mitchell	Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Mitchell_(basketball,_born_1989)	000	000
.

Now
comes
a
much
bigger
challenge
,
even
with
Releford	B	Releford	Trevor_Releford	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Releford	000	000
and
Steele.The
Gators
(
19-6
,
7-3
)
opened
last
March
with
a
78-51
rout
of
a
Tide
team
that
still
had
aspirations
of
winning
an
SEC	B	SEC	Southeastern_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference	000	000
title
and
making
the
NCAA	B	NCAA	NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men's_Division_I_Basketball_Championship	000	000
field
.

Florida	B	Florida	Florida	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida	000	000
is
also
short-handed
,
but
because
of
injuries
.

The
Gators
wo
n’t
have
their
top
subs
,
forward
Will
Yeguete
(
concussion
)
and
guard
Mike
Rosario
(
bruised
hip
)
,
for
the
game

Dear
Ron
,

Having
operated
a
business
for
over
37
years
,
I
understand
and
fully
appreciate
when
someone
provides
a
compliment
for
a
job
well
done
.

We
recently
purchased
a
new
computer
,
after
our
old
horse
was
ready
to
give
up
.

From
my
original
phone
call
to
completion
,
everyone
we
had
contact
with
represented
your
firm
very
well
.

The
salesmen
were
knowledgable
and
provided
assistance
in
my
decision
to
make
the
eventual
purchase
.

Matt
performed
the
installation
of
programs
and
transfer
of
data
to
the
new
computer
.

As
usual
,
he
did
an
excellent
job
.

We
have
always
been
pleased
with
your
service
and
will
certainly
continue
recommending
Connecting
Point
to
our
colleagues
and
friends
.

Thank
you
!

Time
is
up

.

Once
Will	B	Will	Will_Turner	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Turner	000	000
retrieves
said
key
,
Davy	B	Davy Jones	Davy_Jones_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Jones_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)	000	000
Jones	I	Davy Jones	Davy_Jones_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Jones_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)	000	000
is
hot
on
his
trail
,
now
hunting
down
both
Jack	B	Jack	Jack_Nicholson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson	000	000
and
Will	B	Will	Will_Turner	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Turner	000	000
.

It
is
now
,
only
a
matter
of
time
,
before
something
happens
.

Hopefully
the
pirates
can
reach
the
chest
and
stop

The

I
mixed

and
when
I

What
Is
'
Evil
'
?

Written
by
Lee
Marsh

Sunday
,
26
February
2012
21:28
Over
the
past
week
I
have
talked
to
various
people
about
events
in
my
family
.

The
word
“
evil
”
keeps
getting
thrown
around
to
describe
my
mother
.

I
am
always
surprised
by
it
.

I
do
n’t
generally
think
of
people
in
terms
of
their
actions
being
evil
.

So
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
maybe
my
mother
’s
actions
,
or
inactions
,
were
evil.Generally
when
I
am
faced
with
a
question
I
turn
to
the
books
.

I
do
research
.

So
my
research
this
week
involved
the
nature
of
evil
.

What
it
evil
?

How
would
I
recognize
it
when
and
if
I
saw
it
?

So
my
first
stop
is
to
get
the
definition
of
evil
.

you
are
rewarded
for
being
obedient
,
loyal
and
not
shaking
up
the
status
quo
.

Like
a
sales
organization
where
you
are
selling
a
faulty
product
,
initially
members
seem
to
buy
into
the
idea
,
sell
it
passionately
,
but
after
a
while
you
begin
to
see
the
flaws
in
it
,
and
ultimately
realize
that
you
have
a
dud
.

The
April
15
,
2009
Watchtower
,
according
to
sources
I
trust
,
contains
the
following
lines
with
regard
to
what
Jehovah
’s
Witnesses
(
JWs
)
refer
to
as
apostates
,
that
is
,
any
former
Witness
who
now
speaks
openly
questioning
the
Watchtower
Society
(
WTS
)
,
the
Bible
or
the
Witnesses
:
"
Modern
day
apostates
display
characteristics
similar
to
those
of
the
Devil
.

Their
mind
may
be
poisoned
by
a
critical
attitude
towards
individuals
in
the
congregations
,
Christian
elders
or
the
Governing
Body
.

Some
apostates
oppose
the
use
of
the
divine
name
,
Jehovah
.

They
are
not
interested
in
learning
about
Jehovah
,
or
in
serving
him
.

Like
their
father
,
Satan
,
apostates
target
people
of
integrity
.

Episode

Recap

By
Derrick
Bryson
Taylor

Episode
two
of
"
Celebrity
Apprentice
"
was
fabulous
.

However
,
it
was
a

difficult
week
for
the
ladies
as
Dionne	B	Dionne Warwick	Dionne_Warwick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionne_Warwick	000	000
Warwick	I	Dionne Warwick	Dionne_Warwick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionne_Warwick	000	000
and
Dionne	B	Dionne Warwick	Dionne_Warwick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionne_Warwick	000	000
Warwick	I	Dionne Warwick	Dionne_Warwick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionne_Warwick	000	000

continuously
butted
heads
with
project
manager
Lisa	B	Lisa Rinna	Lisa_Rinna	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Rinna	000	000
Rinna	I	Lisa Rinna	Lisa_Rinna	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Rinna	000	000
.

This
week
's
task
was
to
create
a
children
's
book
and
perform
it
in

front
of
an
audience
of
kids
.

The
teams
were
judged
on
originality
,

presentation
and
age
appropriateness
.

From
start
to
finish
,
it
was
an

exciting
two
hours
of
television
.

Check
out
three
moments
that
kept
us

chuckling
and
glued
to
the
TV
...

La
Toya
,
the
Lion

For
nearly
a
half
an
hour
,
Team	B	Team	Team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team	000	000
ASAP
deliberated
and
battled
over
the

theme
and
direction
of
the
children
's
book
they
were
creating
.

Lisa	B	Lisa Rinna	Lisa_Rinna	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Rinna	000	000
Rinna	I	Lisa Rinna	Lisa_Rinna	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Rinna	000	000
failed
to
delegate
and
lead
the
ladies
--
which
we
knew
would
be

hard
,
given
their
personalities
.

After
battling
back
and
forth
about
whether
or
not
the

children
's
book
would
take
on
a
deaf
theme
from
castmate
Marlee	B	Marlee Matlin	Marlee_Matlin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlee_Matlin	000	000
Matlin	I	Marlee Matlin	Marlee_Matlin	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlee_Matlin	000	000
,

the
team
collectively
decided
Dionne	B	Dionne Warwick	Dionne_Warwick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionne_Warwick	000	000
Warwick	I	Dionne Warwick	Dionne_Warwick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionne_Warwick	000	000
's
idea
of
a
lion
developing
the
courage
to
be
himself
was
best
.

La	B	La Toya Jackson	La_Toya_Jackson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Toya_Jackson	000	000
Toya	I	La Toya Jackson	La_Toya_Jackson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Toya_Jackson	000	000
Jackson	I	La Toya Jackson	La_Toya_Jackson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Toya_Jackson	000	000
was
voted
to
be
the
lion
and

she
made
an
impressive
roar
during
the
performance
,
complete
with
a

blond
mane
.

But
it
was
n't
enough
to
impress

guest
judge
Holly	B	Holly Robinson Peete	Holly_Robinson_Peete	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Robinson_Peete	000	000
Robinson	I	Holly Robinson Peete	Holly_Robinson_Peete	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Robinson_Peete	000	000
Peete	I	Holly Robinson Peete	Holly_Robinson_Peete	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Robinson_Peete	000	000
.

Star
Steals
the
Show

During
the
process
of
putting
together
the
book
,
Jones	B	Jones	Star_Jones	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Jones	000	000
recognizes

Rinna	B	Rinna	Lisa_Rinna	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Rinna	000	000
's
weakness
as
a
leader
and
seemingly
ca
n't
help
herself
from
taking
control
.

Star	B	Star	Star_Jones	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Jones	000	000

steps
up
to
the
plate
and
writes
the
children
's
book
with
the
help
of

NeNe	B	NeNe Leakes	NeNe_Leakes	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeNe_Leakes	000	000
Leakes	I	NeNe Leakes	NeNe_Leakes	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeNe_Leakes	000	000
while
the
team
goes
out
to
finish
gathering
props
for
the
show
.

When
the
group
meets
at
the
end
to
finalize
plans
,
Jones	B	Jones	Star_Jones	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Jones	000	000
brings
up
that

she
wants
her
name
on
the
book
which
causes
a
dispute
amongst
the
team
.

Warwick	B	Warwick	Warwick,_Rhode_Island	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick,_Rhode_Island	000	000
soon
jumps
into
the
fight
and
says
she
deserves
credit

too
for
coming
up
with
the
idea
.

SMH	B	SMH	The_Sydney_Morning_Herald	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald	000	000
.

C'mon
ladies
,
it
's
a
team
effort
--
enough
of
the
diva
antics
.

Everyone

surely
participated
in
the
project
whether
or
not
each
idea
was
used
.

To
see
the
ladies
duke
it
out
and
not
come
to
a
concensus
while

the
men
sailed
through
the
process
was
agonizing
.

Boardroom
Brawl

When
it
was
all
said
and
done
,
the
ladies
lost
to
team
Backbone
.

Rinna	B	Rinna	Lisa_Rinna	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Rinna	000	000
dragged
both
Jones	B	Jones	Star_Jones	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Jones	000	000
and
Warwick	B	Warwick	Warwick,_Rhode_Island	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick,_Rhode_Island	000	000
to
the
boardroom
for

elimination
.

Mr.
Trump	B	Trump	Trump	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump	000	000
pointed
out
that
the
main
reasons
the
ladies

failed
at
the
challenge
was
because
of
the
book
's
idea
not
being

original
,
thanks
to
Warwick	B	Warwick	Warwick,_Rhode_Island	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick,_Rhode_Island	000	000
,
and
the
book
not
being
age-appropriate
,

thanks
to
Jones	B	Jones	Star_Jones	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Jones	000	000
.

However
,
the
fierce
and
bold
Jones	B	Jones	Star_Jones	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Jones	000	000
threw
Rinna	B	Rinna	Lisa_Rinna	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Rinna	000	000
under
the
bus
and
let

it
be
known
that
she
did
n't
do
a
good
job
as
project
manager
.

She

explained
that
Rinna	B	Rinna	Lisa_Rinna	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Rinna	000	000
had
lots
to
learn
and
"
Celebrity
Apprentice
"

was
n't
the
place
to
learn
those
skills
.

Rinna	B	Rinna	Lisa_Rinna	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Rinna	000	000
was
eliminated
after

Trump	B	Trump	Trump	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump	000	000
sided
with
Jones	B	Jones	Star_Jones	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Jones	000	000
and
Warwick	B	Warwick	Warwick,_Rhode_Island	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick,_Rhode_Island	000	000
.

One
thing
is
apparent
,
after
watching
last
night
's
episode
,
the
Black

women
on
this
show
are
tough
!

They
're
about
their
business
.

The
other

ladies
should
beware
and
step
up
their
game
if
they
want
to
last

There
is
an
apprehension
running
through
although
Australia	B	Australia	Australia_national_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team	000	000
do
not
want
to
admit
it
as
a
result
of
a
collective
failure
.

’s
wanting

have
turned
around
to

Watson	I	Shane Watson	Shane_Watson	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Watson	000	000
tried
not
to
say
it
.

Australia	B	Australia	Australia_national_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team	000	000
would
be
gutted
if
they
were
to
the
lose

.

The
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000

mystified
.

However
,
like
Ponting	B	Ponting	Ricky_Ponting	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Ponting	000	000
said
,
they
have
only
pride
to
fight
for
.

And
fight
Australia	B	Australia	Australia_national_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team	000	000
must
,
because
England	B	England	England_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team	000	000

they
have

in
disarray
and
can
not
seem
to
put
together
a
strong
batting
performance.But
that
is
the
need
of
the
hour
.

If
Australia	B	Australia	Australia_national_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team	000	000
can
not
get
their
rhythm
together
,
they
may
in
for
more
than
they
bargained
for
when
they
left

Green

is
the
Color
of
Poverty

A
Message
from
Dick
Rowland

It
’s
questionable
whether
or
not
various

initiatives
pushed
by
the
Green	B	Green	Golf_course	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course	000	000
lobby
will
actually
do
anything
beneficial
for

the
environment
.

Less
questionable
is
the
negative
effect
their
policies
will
have

on
the
world
’s
poor
,
who
will
remain
poor
if
the
radical
environmentalists
get

their
way
.

Even

something
as
seemingly
innocuous
as
the
“
carbon
offsets
”
favored
by
Al	B	Al Gore	Al_Gore	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore	000	000
Gore	I	Al Gore	Al_Gore	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Gore	000	000
and

his
ilk
can
end
up
keeping
the
Third	B	Third World	Third_World	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World	000	000
World	I	Third World	Third_World	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_World	000	000
in
poverty
.

According
to
a
recent

headline
in
the
London	B	London Times	The_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times	000	000
Times	I	London Times	The_Times	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times	000	000
,
“
To
cancel
out
the
CO2	B	CO2	Carbon_dioxide	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide	000	000
of
a
return

flight
to
India	B	India	India	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India	000	000
,
it
will
take
one
poor
villager
three
years
of
pumping
water
by

foot
.

So
is
carbon
offsetting
the
best
way
to
ease
your
conscience
?
”

Why
use
a

foot
pump
in
the
21st
century
?

Because
for
offsetting
to
work
,
poor
people

worldwide
have
to
continue
using
outdated
,
nonpolluting
technology
at
the
cost

of
their
own
advancement
and
prosperity
.

Some
have
fairly
called
this

eco-enslavement
.

What
else
would
you
call
it
when
some
poor
person
on
the
other

side
of
the
world
has
to
work
extra
hard
just
so
you
do
n’t
feel
guilty
about

your
SUV
?

This

special
edition
of
GIR
looks
at
the
forgotten
victims
of
the
Green	B	Green	Golf_course	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course	000	000
agenda
:
the

world
’s
poor
who
are
denied
the
benefits
of
the
modern
world
by
elites
who

could
care
less
about
their
well-being
.

Environmental
Activists
Are
Enemies
of
the
Poor

By
Roy
Innis
"

People	B	People	People_(magazine)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)	000	000
here
have
no
jobs
,
"
Mark
Fenn
admitted
,
after
taking

documentary
producers
on
a
tour
of
his
$
35,000
catamaran
and
the
site
of
his
new

coastal
home
.
"

But
if
you
could
count
how
many
times
they
smile
in
a
day
,
if
you

could
measure
stress
"
--
and
compare
that
to
"
well-off
people
"
in
London	B	London	London	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London	000	000
or
New	B	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
York	I	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
--
"
then
tell
me
,
who
is
rich
and
who
is
poor
?
"

Fenn
is
coordinator
of
the
World	B	World Wildlife Fund	World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Fund_for_Nature	000	000

's
campaign
against
a
proposed
mining
project
near
Fort
Dauphin
,
Madagascar	B	Madagascar	Madagascar	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar	000	000
.

The
locals
strongly
support
the
project
and
want
the
jobs
,
improved
port
,
sustained
development
,
and
improved
living
standards
and
environmental
quality
this
state-of-the-art
operation
will
bring
...
.

But
Fenn
claims
the
mine
will
change
the
"
quaint
"
village
and
harm
the
environment
.

He
says
he
feels
"
like
a
resident
,
"
his
children
"
were
born
and
raised
"
there
,
and
the
locals
"
do
n't
consider
education
to
be
important
"
and
would
just
spend
their
money
on
parties
,
jeans
,
and
stereos
.

Like
Figgis

(
LIEBESTRAUM

LEAVING

come
to

)
so
much

,
and
for
the
better
.

Combined
with
signature

by

a
heady
,
visually
engrossing
re-tell
of
a
pretty
standard
story
.

(
apparently

had

removed
after

,
is
simple
.

his
flight
out
of

York	I	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
(
he
lives
in
LA	B	LA	Louisiana	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana	000	000
)
and
spends
the
night
with

Karen
(
Natassha
Kinski
)
,
who
is
also
married
,
in
her
hotel
room
.

The
next
day
he
returns
to
his
wife
Mimi
(
Ming
Na-Wen
)
in
LA	B	LA	Louisiana	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana	000	000
,
who
is
presented
to
us
as
much
louder
,
a
little
tackier
(
she
drives
a
pink
volkswagon
)
and
a
whole
lot
more
bourgeoise
than
t

he
taciturn
and
whispery
Kinski
.

Although
Mimi
does
n't
find
out
,
the
elicit
encounter
takes
its
toil
on
Max
.

He
turns
into
a
huge
asshole
and
troubles
arise
in
his
relationship
with
Mimi
.

A
year
later
,
he
returns
to
New	B	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
York	I	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
to
re-visit
Charlie

,
Jr	B	Jr	Jim_Ross	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ross	000	000
)
,
a
good
friend
with
whom
he
had
reconciled
a
year
earlier
after
a
five-year
feud
.

Charlie
is
now
dying
of
AIDS	B	AIDS	HIV/AIDS	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS	000	000
,
and
his
friends
and
family
are
rallying
round
.

It
's
then
that
Max
meets
Charlie
's
brother
,
Vernon
(
Kyle	B	Kyle MacLachlan	Kyle_MacLachlan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_MacLachlan	000	000
MacLachlan	I	Kyle MacLachlan	Kyle_MacLachlan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_MacLachlan	000	000
)
,
and
sister-i

n-law
.

The
latter
,
as
it
turns
out
,
is
Karen
.

Despite

STAND	I	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
's
three-movement
development
,
the
film
is
built
around
oppositions
and
a
number
of
ironic
contrasts
.

Max
's
pairing
with
Karen
is
conveyed
in
sequences
full
of
silently
exchanged
,
knowing
glances
and
freeze-framed
sensuality
,
bless

ed
by
a
passionate
Beethoven	B	Beethoven	Ludwig_van_Beethoven	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven	000	000
string
quartet
and
heady
fusion
soundtrack
;
his
life
with
Mimi
is
characterized
by
unthinking
pop
music
(
in
a
particuarly
telling
movement
,
a
pop
song
with
a
pounding
bass
beat
bursts
out
the
moment
Max
's
plane
lands
in
the
LA	B	LA airport	Los_Angeles_International_Airport	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport	000	000
airport	I	LA airport	Los_Angeles_International_Airport	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_International_Airport	000	000
,
stamping
out
the
breathless
jazzy
riffs
of
the
night
before
)
,
empty
social
gatherings
peopled
by
non-soulful
Advertising
People
and
dictatorial
sex
.

Parallels
are
also
of
course
drawn
between
New	B	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
York	I	New York	New_York_City	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City	000	000
(
Karen
)
and
LA	B	LA	Louisiana	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana	000	000
(
Mimi
)
.

It
might
all
be

just
a
little
too
obvious
(
how
's
this
for
a
meaningful
comparison
:
the
tryst
takes
place
on
the
night
of
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
the
UN	B	UN	United_Nations	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations	000	000
)
,
but
the
casting
of
characters
as
Types
in
ONE	B	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
NIGHT	I	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
STAND	I	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
ironically
allows
Figgis
to
concentrate
on
the
way
he

tells
the
story
,
and
that
has
always
been
one
of
the
most
interesting
things
about
a
Figgis
film
.

The
heart
of
ONE	B	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
NIGHT	I	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
STAND	I	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
,
and
its
obvious
center
,
is
Charlie
.

Again
,
of
course
,
with
the
strange
coincidences
.

Robert	B	Robert Downey Jr.	Robert_Downey,_Jr.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey,_Jr.	000	000
Downey	I	Robert Downey Jr.	Robert_Downey,_Jr.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey,_Jr.	000	000
Jr.	I	Robert Downey Jr.	Robert_Downey,_Jr.	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey,_Jr.	000	000
is
beautiful
and
saddening
as
the
diminishing
,
wise
Charlie
,
and
it
's
hard
not
to
think
of
his
real-life
problems
with
d

rug
addiction
when
you
watch
him
.

Another
aspect
that
gives
you
a
peculiar
feeling
is
the
visual
similarity
between
the
Snipes-Kinski
coupling
and
that
of
Cage	B	Cage	Nicolas_Cage	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage	000	000
and
Shue	B	Shue	Elisabeth_Shue	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Shue	000	000
in
LEAVING	B	LEAVING LAS VEGAS	Leaving_Las_Vegas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Las_Vegas	000	000
LAS	I	LEAVING LAS VEGAS	Leaving_Las_Vegas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Las_Vegas	000	000
VEGAS	I	LEAVING LAS VEGAS	Leaving_Las_Vegas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Las_Vegas	000	000
.

Both
Natassha
Kinski
and
Elizabeth	B	Elizabeth Shue	Elisabeth_Shue	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Shue	000	000
Shue	I	Elizabeth Shue	Elisabeth_Shue	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Shue	000	000
have
the
same
purity
o

f
profile
and
flaxen
hair
(
it
probably
has
to
do
with
lighting
)
,
and
the
scene
where
Kinski
sits
atop
Snipes	B	Snipes	Wesley_Snipes	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Snipes	000	000
in
ecstasy
inevitably
recalls
its
more
poignant
parallel
in
LEAVING	B	LEAVING LAS VEGAS	Leaving_Las_Vegas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Las_Vegas	000	000
LAS	I	LEAVING LAS VEGAS	Leaving_Las_Vegas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Las_Vegas	000	000
VEGAS	I	LEAVING LAS VEGAS	Leaving_Las_Vegas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaving_Las_Vegas	000	000
.

The
rich
(
inter
)
textuality
and
dense
atmostphere
of
ONE	B	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
NIGHT	I	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
STAND	I	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
make
up
for
what
would
probably
be
,
according
to
classic
Hollywood	B	Hollywood	Hollywood	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood	000	000
conventions
,
poorly
(
or
not
clearly
)
motivated
characters
,

and
also
for
Figgis
'
way
of
leaving
out
standard
Hollywood	B	Hollywood	Hollywood	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood	000	000
m

oments
and
required
information
from
his
narratives
.

Charlie
's
death
is
an
example
.

It
goes
completely
unshown
,
but
yet
is
an
important
event
because
it
eventually
unites
the
menage
a
quatre
in
more
ways
than
one
.

Overall
,
ONE	B	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
NIGHT	I	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
STAND	I	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
is
delightful
,
intelligent
,
and
strange
.

Strange
in
the
way
movies
that
do
n't
tell
you
everything
at
their
ending
are
strange
,
and
not
strange
like
Mimi
from
the
Drew	B	Drew Carey	Drew_Carey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Carey	000	000
Carey	I	Drew Carey	Drew_Carey	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Carey	000	000
show
.

A
lot
of
this
has
to
do
with
the
wonderful
perfor

mances
given
by
all
the
lead
characters
.

Kinski	B	Kinski	Klaus_Kinski	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Kinski	000	000
--
how
old
is
this
women
?!

--
does
a
good
job
of
being
both
winsome
and
mystifying
(
winstifying
?
)

at
the
same
time
,
while
Wen
and
Snipes	B	Snipes	Wesley_Snipes	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Snipes	000	000
are
good
at
winning
both
our
empathy
and
dislike
.

Post-affair
Max
,
f

or
example
,
is
a
combination
of
obnoxiousness
and
anger
that
can
be
somewhat
distancing
,
and
because
the
movie
seems
to
be
told
from
his
perspective
,
it
is
n't
always
easy
to
understand
what
he
's
going
through
.

Overwhelmingly
shunned
by
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
audiences
,
ONE	B	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000

STAND	I	ONE NIGHT STAND	One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Night_Stand_(1997_film)	000	000
is
a
pleasant
shelter
from
current
blockbuster
offerings
,
whether
they
be
the
stultifyingly
banal
I
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
DID
LAST

Instruments

of
Navigation

Deceptively
like
a

common
sundial
,
William
Borough
's
instrument
to
determine
magnetic

variation
pushed
the
envelope
of
scientific
understanding
in
1581
.

But
more
than
that
,
it
encapsulated
a
thorny
scientific
problem

within
a
very
simple
instrument
--
so
simple
that
a
sailor
could

use
it
.

Since
the
magnetic
poles
do
not
lie
in
the
same
place
on

the
earth
's
globe
as
the
true
north
and
south
poles
,
a
compass
needle

will
usually
not
point
directly
at
the
geographic
pole
.

The
deviation

depends
on
where
the
compass
is
in
relation
to
the
magnetic
pole

as
well
as
local
geomagnetic
conditions
.

Knowing
this
"
magnetic

variation
"
was
of
crucial
importance
to
navigators
trying
to

avoid
being
lost
at
sea
.

It
was
of
particular
concern
to
those
plying

the
North	B	North Atlantic	Atlantic_Ocean	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean	000	000
Atlantic	I	North Atlantic	Atlantic_Ocean	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean	000	000
.

Near
the
equator
,
variation
might
only
be
a

degree
or
so
,
but
in
northern
waters
,
it
can
vary
up
to
90
°
.

Near
Greenland	B	Greenland	Greenland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland	000	000
,
navigators
could
conceivably
be
sailing
west
when

they
thought
they
were
sailing
north
.

Borough
therefore

put
into
a
simple
instrument
all
the
tools
that
the
navigator
needed

to
find
and
map
variation
at
any
point
on
the
globe
.

This

woodcut
reduces
a
complex
exercise
in
terrestrial
geomagnetic
and

spherical
geometry
to
a
simple
image
of
a
simple
instrument
made

up
of
simple
and
known
commodities
:
compass
and
sundial
.

Designed

for
workaday
purposes
and
not
purporting
to
reveal
any
hidden
truths

of
the
earth
or
heavens
,
the
instrument
of
variation
allowed
English	B	English	England	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England	000	000

sailors
to
map
the
North	B	North Atlantic	Atlantic_Ocean	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean	000	000
Atlantic	I	North Atlantic	Atlantic_Ocean	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean	000	000
.

The
timeliness
of
the
book
and

the
instrument
it
explained
are
underscored
by
recalling
that
the

English	B	English	England	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England	000	000
only
began
seriously
contemplating
overseas
exploration

and
colonies
in
the
1570s
(
Drake	B	Drake	Drake_(rapper)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(rapper)	000	000
returned
from
his
circumnavigation

in
1578
)
and
her
first
colony
was
(
unsuccessfully
)
planted
on
Roanoke	B	Roanoke	Roanoke,_Virginia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roanoke,_Virginia	000	000

in
1584
.

Although
described
by
Borough	B	Borough	Borough_(New_Jersey)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough_(New_Jersey)	000	000
--
the
more
able
mathematician
--
the

instrument
was
apparently
invested
with
great
meaning
for
Robert	B	Robert Norman	Robert_Norman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Norman	000	000
Norman	I	Robert Norman	Robert_Norman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Norman	000	000
(
fl
.

1590
)
,
who
took
the
trouble
to
have
his
initials
placed

at
the
foot
of
the
shadow
line
,
identifying
this
invention
and
this

embodied
knowledge
as
his
own
.

The
instrument
worked

as
follows
:
Placing
the
instrument
level
and
plumb
on
a
stool
and

aligning
the
shadow
from
the
cord
on
the
NS	B	NS	Nova_Scotia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia	000	000
line
of
the
compass

dial
,
the
navigator
noted
the
position
of
the
needle
at
two
times

in
the
day
when
the
sun
was
at
equal
elevations
above
the
horizon
--
that

is
,
at
equal
times
on
either
side
of
local
noon
.

Half
the
difference

in
the
absolute
value
of
these
two
needle
positions
gave
the
local

magnetic
variation
since
magnetic
north
is
not
in
quite
the
same

direction
as
true
north
(
the
north
magnetic
pole
lies
at
about
77
°

N
lat.
,
45
°
W
long
.
)

.

So
,
for
example
,
at
8
AM
the
needle
might

point
48
°
E
and
at
4pm
point
45
°
W
;
the
local
magnetic
variation

would
then
be
1.5
°
E
(
[
48
°
-45
°
]
/
2
)
at
that
point
on
the

globe
.

The
next
time
any
ship
came
to
the
area
,
then
,
it
would
be

able
to
compensate
for
that
1.5
°
and
sail
towards
its
destination

reliably
.

One
limitation
of
this
instrument
,
however
,
was
that
to

determine
the
most
accurate
declinations
,
the
readings
ought
to

have
been
taken
as
far
apart
in
the
day
as
possible
,
but
that
meant

the
mariner
had
to
stay
put
for
most
or
all
of
that
day
,
not
only

a
difficult
task
on
the
ocean
,
but
also
quite
inefficient
in
terms

of
reaching
one
's
destination
.

Ultimately
,
though
,
this
instrument

and
many
more
like
it
defined
the
mathematical
arts
for
late-sixteenth-century

Englishmen	B	Englishmen	English_people	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people	000	000
and
the
world
they
sought
to
create

QUESTION

I
want
to
refinance
our
first
mortgage
,
but
the
second
mortgage
holder
wo
n't
subordinate
.

What
can
we
do
?

Read
full
question

We
found
a
company
that
will
refinance
our
first
,
but
the
second
lien
holder
will
not
subordinate
without
a
full
appraisal
.

We
have
already
paid
them
$
150
and
they
wo
n't
return
it
even
though
they
did
n't
do
the
subordination
.

What
department
within
the
second
mortgage
company
would
we
write
to
request
a
loan
rate
reduction
?

If
they
refuse
to
reduce
the
interest
rate
,
what
other
recourse
would
we
have
?

Can
we
offer
a
settlement
of
10
cents
on
the
dollar
?

I
noticed
several
other
people
in
your
comments
have
been
able
to
do
this
.

BILL
'S
ANSWER

As
part
of
its
efforts
to
stimulate
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
economy
,
the
Federal	B	Federal Reserve	Federal_Reserve_System	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System	000	000
Reserve	I	Federal Reserve	Federal_Reserve_System	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System	000	000
has
lowered
interest
rates
to
record
low
levels
in
2008
and
2009
,
which
in
part
has
allowed
banks
to
offer
some
attractive
rates
to
homeowners
wishing
to
take
out
a
new
mortgage
or
refinance
an
existing
loan
.

Refinancing
when
the
loan
balances
exceed
the
property
value

Although
many
current
homeowners
would
like
to
refinance
their
home
loans
to
take
advantage
of
the
low
interest
rates
,
the
downturn
in
property
values
has
resulted
in
many
owing
second
mortgages
or
home
equity
loans
that
push
their
total
current
financing
perilously
close
to
,
if
not
over
,
the
actual
values
of
their
homes
.

In
this
situation
,
a
refinance
lender
is
unlikely
to
loan
the
homeowner
enough
money
to
combine
the
first
and
second
mortgages
into
a
single
obligation
,
as
the
lender
does
not
want
to
extend
a
loan
that
exceeds
the
value
of
the
property
securing
debt
.

The
refi
lender
may
be
willing
to
refinance
the
first
mortgage
,
but
only
if
the
lender
holding
the
second
mortgage
or
home
equity
loan
is
willing
to
give
the
refi
lender
's
encumbrance
on
the
property
seniority
over
the
second
mortgage
.

Allow
me
to
travel
on
a
momentary
tangent
regarding
legal
terminology
.

In
Colorado	B	Colorado	Colorado	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado	000	000
,
California	B	California	California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California	000	000
,
Texas	B	Texas	Texas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas	000	000
and
18
other
states
the
"
mortgage
"
is
actually
a
"
deed
of
trust
.
"

Legally
,
the
two
are
different
,
but
a
comparison
of
the
two
exceeds
the
scope
of
this
discussion
.

Although
it
is
inaccurate
technically
to
call
a
Colorado	B	Colorado	Colorado	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado	000	000
home
loan
a
mortgage
,
we
will
continue
to
refer
to
the
first
and
second
loan
on
the
property
here
a
mortgage
because
that
is
expected
and
understood
by
our
non-property
lawyer
readers
.

Subordination

Getting
back
to
the
subordination
issue
,
without
such
an
agreement
,
the
second
mortgage
,
as
the
older
debt
,
would
become
the
senior
encumbrance
on
the
property
once
the
refi
lender
pays
off
the
first
mortgage
as
part
of
the
refinance
.

Unfortunately
,
unless
you
have
a
significant
equity
cushion
,
the
bank
holding
your
second
mortgage
loan
is
likely
to
refuse
to
agree
to
subordinate
its
encumbrance
,
especially
if
you
are
planning
to
"
cash
out
"
any
of
your
equity
by
borrowing
more
from
the
refi
lender
than
you
currently
owe
on
the
first
mortgage
.

The
secondary
lender
's
position
is
already
relatively
weak
in
terms
of
its
ability
to
enforce
its
security
interest
in
the
home
,
since
it
would
be
required
to
either
pay
off
or
otherwise
receive
the
first
mortgage
lender
's
consent
to
proceed
with
foreclosure
.

Given
its
already
tenuous
ability
to
force
repayment
,
the
secondary
lender
is
unlikely
to
agree
to
subordination
to
a
"
cash
out
"
refi
loan
,
which
would
eat
up
the
small
amount
of
equity
to
which
it
may
be
able
to
lay
claim
in
case
of
default
.

On
the
other
hand
,
if
you
can
show
the
second
mortgage
holder
that
the
refi
loan
will
actually
reduce
the
risk
of
default
on
your
home
loans
by
reducing
your
total
mortgage
payments
each
month
,
you
may
find
the
secondary
lender
more
willing
to
cooperate
with
you
and
the
bank
providing
the
refinance
loan
.

Consult
with
the
agent
handling
your
potential
refinance
loan
,
as
well
as
any
other
mortgage
professionals
you
know
,
to
discuss
the
best
way
to
present
your
plan
to
the
second
mortgage
lender
.

The
key
is
making
the
lender
believe
that
the
refinance
loan
and
required
subordination
will
ultimately
serve
its
interests
.

Appraisal
by
second
mortgage
company

In
your
question
,
you
state
that
your
second
mortgage
company
has
requested
a
full
appraisal
of
your
property
before
it
will
consider
agreeing
to
subjugate
its
encumbrance
to
that
of
the
company
through
which
you
are
trying
to
refinance
your
first
mortgage
.

First
,
you
should
understand
that
demanding
a
complete
appraisal
of
the
home
's
value
is
not
unusual
.

The
second
mortgage
company
wants
to
determine
how
much
equity
you
currently
have
in
the
property
(
the
more
equity
,
the
more
likely
junior
encumbrances
will
be
paid
in
case
of
foreclosure
)
,
and
how
the
proposed
refinance
loan
will
affect
this
equity
cushion
.

It
will
also
want
to
determine
if
you
are
"
upside-down
"
on
the
property
(
you
owe
more
that
the
home
is
worth
)
,
as
being
in
this
position
significantly
increases
the
possibility
that
you
will
default
on
one
or
all
of
your
mortgage
obligations
.

Here
,
it
sounds
like
the
lender
has
refused
to
subordinate
,
and
refused
to
refund
the
appraisal
fee
paid
.

Unfortunately
,
I
do
not
think
that
you
have
much
recourse
in
this
regard
,
as
appraisal
fees
are
usually
non-refundable
.

However
,
if
you
think
that
you
were
mislead
by
the
lender
,
you
may
want
to
contact
the
Colorado
Dept.
of
Real	B	Real Estate	Real_estate	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate	000	000
Estate	I	Real Estate	Real_estate	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate	000	000
and
the
Colorado	B	Colorado	Colorado	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado	000	000
Attorney
General
's
Office
to
file
complaints
against
the
lender
.

While
these
agencies
can
not
guarantee
you
a
favorable
outcome
,
they
are
often
successful
in
mediating
disputes
between
consumers
and
businesses
.

Loan
modification

You
are
correct
in
pointing
out
that
a
Bills.com
reader
reported
that
a
second
mortgage
holder
made
a
lump-sum
settlement
with
a
homeowner
for
10
cents
on
the
dollar
.

Keep
in
mind
that
there
are
dozens
of
companies
making
second
mortgage
loans
,
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
second
mortgages
under
contract
.

Your
lender
may
not
offer
such
attractive
settlement
terms
.

As
for
what
department
at
the
second
mortgage
company
you
need
to
contact
to
discuss
the
possible
modification
of
your
loan
terms
(
payment
amount
,
interest
rate
,
loan
term
,
etc.
)
,
you
should
probably
start
by
contacting
the
general
customer
service
department
.

They
may
help
you
directly
,
but
a
good
CS	B	CS	Credit_Suisse	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse	000	000
agent
should
be
able
to
point
you
to
the
correct
department
(
probably
named
something
like
"
loss
mitigation
,
"
though
this
will
depend
on
your
specific
lender
)

I
have
run
into
the
situation
whereby
my
Home
Equity
Lender
will
not
re-subordinate
and
accomodate
my
refinance
.

In
this
case
my
refinance
will
be
a
lower
loan
amount
,
a
lower
monthly
payment
and
will
convert
an
interest
only
loan
to
an
amortizing
loan
.

I
have
also
expressed
the
ability
to
slightly
reduce
my
Home
Equity
Line
.

The
appraised
value
of
the
combined
loans
will
be
80
%
and
the
original
home
equity
loan
was
made
at
86
%
.

Have
you
heard
of
anything
so
absurd
?

Do
you
know
of
anyone
attorney
's
taking
on
law
suits
in
this
instance
.

Obvious
damages
would
be
lost
equity
of
the
term
and
the
lossed
opportunity
to
reduce
monthly
payments
.

Diocese
of
Melbourne
motion
supporting
ACNA
defeated

Oct
30th
,
2009
by
David

An
update
to
this
post
:

Received
by
email
:

It
was
a
close
vote
.

The
debate
went
for
the
full
30
minutes
,
and
was
charitable
for
the
most
part
,
except
one
well-known
agitator
in
the
Melbourne
Diocese
in
Australia	B	Australia	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
claiming
the
motion
and
its
motives
were
“
disingenuous
”
--
that
was
a
low
point
.

The
vote
by
voices
was
n’t
able
to
decide
whether
the
motion
had
passed
or
been
defeated
,
so
someone
asked
for
a
count
of
the
house
.

It
turns
out
there
was
just
a
quorum
of
people
--
in
Melbourne
Diocese
only
a
third
of
Synod
(
284
people
,
I
think
)
is
required
to
be
present
for
a
quorum
--
there
were
325
Synod
members
present
who
voted
on
the
motion
(
either
for
or
against
)
.

On
a
count
of
hands
175
people
were
“
against
”
,
150
people
“
for
”
.

The
motion
was
lost
by
25
people
.

It
was
a
close
vote
!

The
saddest
aspects
to
the
vote
are
twofold
:
i.
a
decent
number
of
Synod
members
had
little
idea
of
what
the
motion
was
really
about
(
that
is
,
they
were
confused
by
the
whole
thing
and
they
are
n’t
aware
that
ACNA	B	ACNA	Anglican_Church_in_North_America	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Church_in_North_America	000	000
-
affiliated
parishes
are
being
dragged
through
the
courts
to
acquire
their
properties
)
,
even
after
some
careful
,
but
informative
speeches
from
the
mover
and
seconder
of
the
motion
;
and
,
ii.
,
to
lose
the
motion
by
25
people
is
disappointing
,
given
that
there
were
a
number
of
people
absent
from
Synod
who
would
have
voted
in
favour
of
the
motion
if
they
were
there
--
this
is
one
of
those
“
luck
of
the
draw
”
situations
,
where
you
do
n’t
know
the
exact
timing
of
the
hearing
of
the
motion
.

If
all
the
facts
are
true
this
is
a
perfect
argument
for
the
“
disingenuous
”
nature
of
currect
Synod
operations
.

I
submit
that
until
we
adopt
a
procedure
whereby
all
motions
must
be
passed
unanimously
,
or
tabled
for
further
action
we
leave
a
thin
edge
for
the
wedge
.

I
hope
arguments
follow
,
but
please
do
not
forget
the
“
Factor
of
Faith
”

If
we
need
100
%
in
favor
or
against
votes
,
does
n’t
this
lead
to
what
is
called
dictatorship
?

Only
a
dictatorial
government
can
achieve
unanimous
agreement
ALL
of
the
time
.

Irena
:

methinks
you
to
be
more
right
than
wrong
on
the
idea
that
democratic
votes
usually
go
against
the
Lord	B	Lord	Lord	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord	000	000
’s
favor
.

Seems
that
has
always
been
the
case
~
~
~
~
unless
all
the
voters
or
at
least
the
majority
of
the
voters
are
“
Christians	B	Christians	Christian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian	000	000
”
,
then
it
goes
to
the
Lord	B	Lord	Lord	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord	000	000
’s
favor
of
course
.

Unfortunately
todays
society
thinks
themselves
in

America	I	North America	North_America	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America	000	000
to
be
Christian	B	Christian	Christian	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian	000	000
but
have
been
so
far
led
away
from
the
truth
that
they
are
not

How
unfortunate
and
sad

Dictatorship	B	Dictatorship	Dictatorship	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship	000	000
and
Monarchist
Government
is
always
unanimous
“
all
the
time
”

Were
the
requirment
for
unanimity
in
Synod
operations
does
not
garantee
“
all
the
time
”
when
a
motion
does
not
pass
it
is
tabled
.

The
procedure
or
follow
up
on
a
tabled
motion
is
varied
.

My
personal
choice
is
to
put
it
off
until
the
next
synod
.

This
leaves
time
for
healthy
discussion
,
debate
,
and
prayer
.

If
the
next
Synod
(
second
reading
)
fails
to
reach
unanimous
agreement
than
the
Bishop	B	Bishop	Bishop	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop	000	000
in
Charge	B	Charge	Charge_(heraldry)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(heraldry)	000	000
would
strike
a
committee
of
pro
and
con
persons
based
on
the
same
percentage
as
the
second
vote
.

Thes
folks
would
be
tasked
(
like
a
jury
)
to
determine
unanimous
consent
.

Any
and
all
arguments
can
be
submitted
to
said
committee
during
the
interim
.

The
result
-
unanimous
or
hung
,
is
presented
during
third
Synod
(
reading
)
if
vote
is
not
unanimous
than
the
Motion
is
tossed
.

Irena
;
I
have
defended
the
premise
of
“
same
Accord	B	Accord	Honda_Accord	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Accord	000	000
”
as
a
source
of
Spiritual
Power
.

I
believe
that
“
in
my
name
”

means
“
of
the
same
accord
”
.

The
fact
that
I
could
not
find
the
quote
I
used
in
my
#
9
was
a
shock
to
me
as
I
have
used
it
so
often
.

I
apologize
for
the
confusing
mis-quote
.

I
do
n’t
agree
with
your
contextual
assessment
.

Matt
.18
:
19
Again
I
say
unto
you
,
That
if
two
of
you
shall
agree
on
earth
as
touching
any
thing
that
they
shall
ask
,
it
shall
be
done
for
them
of
my
Father
which
is
in
heaven
.

.

For
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
name
,
there
am
I
in
the
midst
of
them
.

Philippians
2:2

Fulfil
ye
my
joy
,
that
ye
be
likeminded
,
having
the
same
love
,
being
of
one
accord
,
of
one
mind
.

Acts
1:14

These
all
continued
with
one
accord
in
prayer
and
supplication
,
with
the
women
,
and
Mary	B	Mary the mother of Jesus	Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_(mother_of_Jesus)	000	000

Being
of
one
accord
and
“
in
my
name
”
are
certainly
tightly
related
,
as
the
verses
in
your
previous
post
show
.

If
we
are
considering
a
matter
together
in
Jesus	B	Jesus	Jesus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus	000	000
’
name
--
that
is
,
if
we
really
do
stand
under
his
authority
and
in
his
love
,
as
I
think
the
phrase
suggests
--
we
will
be
of
like
mind
because
we
’ll
be
sharing
in
the
mind
of
Christ	B	Christ	Christ	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ	000	000
(
Phil
.

2
,
v.
5
)
.

When
the
glory
and
honour
of
the
Lord
Jesus	B	Jesus	Jesus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus	000	000
are
at
stake
,
this
kind
of
accord
will
look
like
unanimity
.

And
I
think
this
is
how
ACNA	B	ACNA	Anglican_Church_in_North_America	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Church_in_North_America	000	000
has
so
wonderfully
been
founded
among
groups
so
varying
in
detail
.

We
all
knew
we
could
n’t
stay
with
the
National
Churches
because
the
very
Lordship
of
Christ	B	Christ	Christ	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ	000	000
was
being
questioned
in
these
churches
.

On
the
subject
of
non-essentials
(
where
the
Bible	B	Bible	Bible	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible	000	000
is
not
totally
clear
on
a
subject
,
for
example
)
,
the
accord
will
look
more
like
mutual
submission
in
which
we
leave
our
pet
issues
aside
for
the
sake
of
unity
.

Mutual
submission
may
not
look
at
all
like
agreement
or
unanimity
,
but
it
will
glorify
the
Lord
Jesus	B	Jesus	Jesus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus	000	000

Domestic
Violence
Facts

Domestic
violence
is
both
a
national
and
a
worldwide
crisis
.

According
to
a
2000
UNICEF
study
,
20-50
%
of
the
female

population
of
the
world
will
become
the
victims
of
domestic

violence
.1

Within
the
United
States
,
22.1
%
of

women
will
experience
violence
by
an
intimate
partner
sometime

during
her
lifetime
.

According
to
the
National
Violence
Against
Women
Survey
,
17.6
%
of
women
will
be
raped

during
her
lifetime
.4
"

A
Crime
Against
Women
"

Although
men
are
more
likely
to
be
victims
of
violent

crime
overall
,
a
recent
study
by
the
U.S.
Department
of

Justice
reports
that
"
intimate
partner
violence
is
primarily

a
crime
against
women
.
"

2

Of
those
victimized
by
an
intimate
partner
,
85
%
are
women

and
15
%
are
men
.2
In
other
words
,
women
are
5
to
8
times

more
likely
than
men
to
be
victimized
by
an
intimate

partner
.3

The
vast
majority
of
domestic
assaults
are
committed
by

men
.

Even
when
men
are
victimized
,
10
%
are
assaulted
by

another
man
.

In
contrast
,
only
2
%
of
women
who
are
victimized

are
assaulted
by
another
woman
.2

Vulnerability
Factors

Women
age
16
to
24
are
most
likely
to
be
victimized
by

an
intimate
partner
.2

African-American
women
experience
more
domestic

violence
than
White
women
in
the
age
group
of
20-24
.

However
,

Black
and
White
women
experience
the
same
level
of

victimization
in
all
other
age
categories
.2

Hispanic
women
are
less
likely
to
be
victimized

than
non-Hispanic
women
in
every
age
group
.2

Women
are
most
vulnerable
to
violence
when
separated
from
their
intimate
partner
.

The
second
most
vulnerable

group
are
those
who
are
divorced
.2
This
can
discourage
women
from
leaving
their
abusive
partner
,

out
of
fear
that
it
will
increase
their
risk
of
victimization
.

Physical
Injury

Approximately
40-50
%
of
female
victims
are
physically

injured
when
assaulted
by
their
intimate
partner
,2
,

4
accounting
for
over
200,000
visits
to
the
hospital

emergency
room
each
year
.5

Only
about
1
in
5
of
domestic
violence
victims
with

physical
injuries
seek
professional
medical
treatment
.3

Murder

Women
are
far
more
likely
than
men
to
be
murdered
by
an

intimate
partner
.

Of
those
murdered
by
their
intimate
partner
,

74
%
are
women
and
26
%
are
men
.2
In

other
words
,
nearly
3
out
of
4
of
the
murders
committed

by
intimate
partners
have
a
female
victim
.

The
FBI
reports
that
between
1976
and
1996
,
domestic
violence

claims
the
lives
of
more
than
four
women
each
day
.3

Between
1976
and
1996
,
there
was
a
"
sharp
decrease
"
in

the
number
of
men
murdered
by
intimate
partners
,
whereas

the
number
of
women
murdered
by
an
intimate
partner
remained

constant
.3
Some
have
attributed
this

to
the
increasing
availability
of
shelters
which
provide

battered
women
with
options
other
than
killing
an
abusive

partner
.

It
is
possible
that
some
women
who
might
have
otherwise

killed
their
abuser
are
able
to
leave
and
go
to
a
shelter
.

Under-reporting
of

Domestic
Violence
to
Police

Only
about
half
of
domestic
violence
incidents
are
reported

to
police
.

African-American
women
are
more
likely
than
others

to
report
their
victimization
to
police
.3

The
most
common
reasons
for
not
reporting
domestic
violence

to
police
are
that
victims
view
the
incident
as
a
personal

or
private
matter
,
they
fear
retaliation
from
their
abuser
,

and
they
do
not
believe
that
police
will
do
anything
about

the
incident
.3

Even
with
this
dramatic
under-reporting
,
domestic
violence

calls
constitute
approximately
half
of
all
violent
crime

calls
to
police
departments
.

For
example
,
49
%
of
the
violent

crime
calls
received
by
the
DC
Metropolitan
Police
Department

in
2000
were
for
domestic
violence
incidents
.6

Police
Response
Frequently

Inadequate

Skepticism
regarding
the
quality
of
police
response
is

grounded
in
reality
.

A
recent
study
by
the
D.C.
Metropolitan

Police
Department
concluded
that
there
was
a
"
clear
and

pervasive
pattern
"
of
departures
from
departmental
policy
.6

For
example
,
in
only
one-third
of
the
domestic

violence
calls
did
an
officer
take
photographs
or
ask
about

prior
abuse
.6

Only
17
%
of
the
victims
were
asked
about
a
restraining

order
,
and
83
%
were
provided
no
printed
information
with
contact
information
or
resources
.6

The
Myth
of
"
Mutuality
"

Although
many
studies
report
that
men
and
women
use
physical

violence
at
equal
rates
within
intimate
relationships
,7
,

8
this
fails
to
take
into
account
the
nature
of
the

violence
and
the
level
of
fear
and
injury
experienced
by

each
party
.

Several
studies
document
that
women
experience
higher

levels
of
fear
than
men
do
in
domestic
violence
situations
.9
,

10
,
11
,
12
,
13
This
is
perhaps
because
women
in
domestic

violence
situations
are
much
more
likely
to
be
injured
--

and
injured
severely
--
than
men
are
.8

Recent
years
have
seen
an
increase
in
the
number
of
women

arrested
for
domestic
violence
.

For
example
,
the
percentage

of
women
arrested
for
domestic
violence
increased
in
Concord	B	Concord	Concord,_New_Hampshire	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord,_New_Hampshire	000	000
,

New	B	New Hampshire	New_Hampshire	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire	000	000
Hampshire	I	New Hampshire	New_Hampshire	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire	000	000
from
23
%
in
1993
to
35
%
in
1999
.

Vermont	B	Vermont	Vermont	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont	000	000
saw

a
similar
increase
from
16
%
in
1997
to
23
%
in
1999.18

Some	B	Some	Some_Records	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Some_Records	000	000
have
attributed
this
to
the
increase
in
"
mandatory

arrest
"
policies
,
in
which
police
are
required
to
make
an

arrest
if
there
is
probable
cause
that
a
person
has
committed

domestic
violence
.

Passage
of
these
laws
was
advocated
by

feminists
and
domestic
violence
experts
to
address
the
inadequate

response
to
domestic
violence
victims
by
law
enforcement
.

When
officers
arrive
at
the
scene
of
a
domestic
violence

crime
,
they
often
cite
evidence
that
both
partners
have

engaged
in
some
aggressive
behavior
,
and
arrest
both
the

man
and
the
woman
.

This
"
dual
arrest
"
strategy
fails
to

take
into
account
which
of
two
people
is
primarily
responsible

for
the
aggression
and
which
one
is
responding
out
of
self-defense
,

and
can
have
devastating
effects
,
particularly
if
there

are
children
involved
in
the
relationship
.

To
counteract
this
problem
,
some
departmental
or
statewide

policies
now
provide
guidelines
for
an
officer
to
determine

who
is
the
"
primary
aggressor
"
in
a
violent
incident
.

For

example
,
the
California
Commission
on
Peace
Officer
Standards

and
Training
publishes
a
guidebook
for
officers
responding

to
domestic
violence
,
discouraging
"
dual
arrests
"
and
outlining

several
factors
to
consider
when
determining
who
is
the

primary
aggressor
in
a
domestic
violence
situation
.

The

primary
aggressor
is
defined
as
"
the
person
determined
to

be
the
most
significant
,
rather
than
the
first
,
aggressor
.
"

Factors
to
consider
include
the
history
of
domestic
violence

between
the
people
involved
,
the
threats
and
fear
level

of
each
person
,
and
whether
either
person
acted
in
self

defense
.

These
are
appropriate
considerations
when
determining

who
is
the
primary
aggressor
,
and
therefore
which
of
the

two
parties
should
be
arrested

Does
n't
it
change
with
every
Job
,
or
job
level
?

I
just
shot
something
where
I
was
Everything
:
loader
,
Grip	B	Grip	Grip_(job)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grip_(job)	000	000
,
Gaffer	B	Gaffer	Gaffer_(filmmaking)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaffer_(filmmaking)	000	000
,
Food
stylist
,
ETC.
(
however
this
was
something
for
me
,
so
I
was
also
the
director
)
.

I
will
not
shoot
without
an
AC	B	AC	Alternating_current	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current	000	000
,
it
is
necessary
to
have
one
.

I
wonder
if
your
question
is
n't
broad
enough
though
.

besides
the
duties
:

Preproduction
planning
,
scheduling
,
Choosing
equipment
(
on
my
level
I
tend
to
be
the
one
writing
the
order
for
Grip/Electric
,
as
well
as
Camera	B	Camera	Camera	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera	000	000
,
I
'm
sure
that
there
are
many
who
DP	B	DP	Management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management	000	000
's
who
work
bigger
budgeted/crewed
jobs
who
discuss
the
job
with
their
Keys
,
and
let
them
take
care
of
the
specifics
,
such
as
how
many
C-stands
and
sand
bags
)
,
color
timing
(
either
TK
,
or
Print	B	Print	Publishing	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing	000	000
{
with
a
colorist
}
)
.

I
've
gone
on
location
scouts
alone
and
ended
up
having
to
secure
the
location
for
production
(
being
grilled
by
a
member
of
the
Judiciary
is
not
fun
)
,
and
I
wo
n't
do
that
again
.

It
seems
to
me
,
that
the
DP	B	DP	Management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management	000	000
is
also
Management	B	Management	Management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management	000	000
(
when
looked
at
from
a
labor
stand
point
)
.

Although
it
is
not
always
the
case
,
certainly
there
are
crossover
aspects
from
each
side
.

Besides
asking
what
a
DP	B	DP	Management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management	000	000
's
duties
are
,
should
we
also
ask
over
which
"
things
"
(
for
want
of
a
better
word
)
a
DP	B	DP	Management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management	000	000
has
absolute
control
over
,
and
can
not
be
overidden
?

It
is
a
tough
question
,
I
've
gone
from
one
shoot
that
was
so
badly
organized
by
production
that
I
had
to
do
the
Tie	B	Tie	Tie_(draw)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(draw)	000	000
in
,
run
the
cable
,
and
hang
most
of
the
lights
(
as
well
as
share
AD	B	AD	Advertising	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising	000	000
duties
with
the
Sound	B	Sound	Sound	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound	000	000
man
and
the
KEY
P.A.
)
.

To
two
days
later
Working
on
a
great
shoot
that
All
I
had
to
do
was
talk
with
the
director
,
and
operate
the
Camera
.

The
AC	B	AC	Alternating_current	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current	000	000
and
the
Grips
did
all
the
technical
work
I
asked
for
(
NO
lights
)
.

It
really
changes
on
a
job
to
job
basis
(
for
me
)
,
sometimes
what
I
do
changes
in
the
middle
of
the
Job
,
especially
if
the
Director
becomes
a
jerk
,
and
I
am
working
way
too
hard
for
no
reason
(
at
that
point
SUPERHUMAN
Steve
goes
away
)
.

Steven
(
well
that
's
my
view
of
it
,
You
must
have
a
reason
for
asking
this
Geoff

Gladstone
-
wow
I
even
worked
a
little
ranting
into
my
answer

http://members.aol.com/veenotph

Having
been
blessed
with
the
opportunity
to
work
in
a
wide
variety
of
types
of
production
,
eg
.16,35
,
IMAX	B	IMAX	IMAX	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX	000	000
docs
,
ride
films
,
corporate
,
industrial
,
medical
,
political
,
commercial
,
broadcast
sports
,
brroadcast
news
,
broadcast
magazine
,
broadcast
dramatic
,
music
video
,
indies
,
and
big
studio
pictures
and
in
many
different
countries
under
different
types
of
systems
,
I
would
try
to
define
the
DP	B	DP	Management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management	000	000
's
role
using
those
horrible
Venn
diagrams
of
the
"
new
math
"
era
,
a
dark
period
in
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
public
school
education
.

There
is
a
core
set
of
responsibilites
which
is
,
I
think
,
shared
by
DP	B	DP	Management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management	000	000
's
in
all
types
of
production
(
except
perhaps
non-dramatic
and
"
soap
opera
"
multicam
studio
TV
work
which
has
Lighting
Directors
and
operators
but
often
no
DP	B	DP	Management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management	000	000
)
.

Those
responsibilites
would
include
the
aesthetic
decision-making
for
lighting
,
exposure
,
and
filtration
and
the
choice
of
camera
,
lenses
,
and
camera
support
equipment
.

Past
that
core
,
the
additional
responsibilites
seem
to
depend
on
both
the
general
type
of
work
and
on
the
specific
project
team
and
relationships
between
them
.

It
seems
that
in
addition
to
the
core
responsibilities
,
the
DP
will
also
handle
at
least
one
,
generally
two
or
three
,
and
sometimes
all
of
the
following
additional
duties
:
(
not
ranked
by
importance
)

Timing/grading
of
images

Decisions
concerning
camera
placement
and
movement
(
sometimes
but
not
always
shared
with
the
Director
)

Operating
camera
(
often
delegated
to
an
operator
and
sometimes
usurped
by
a
director
)

Technical
decisions
concerning
lighting
(
often
shared
with
the
gaffer
&
key
grip
,
and
in
a
few
cases
the
Director
-
eg.Stanley
and
Ridley
)

Technical
decisions
concerning
equipment
used
to
move
and
support
camera
(
often
shared
with
the
Key
grip
)

Actor
movement
and
blocking
(
shared
with
some
directors
)

Aesthetic
and
technical
issues
concerning
set
painting
and
treatment
(
in
concert
with
prod
designer
,
art
director
,
director
,
and
in
commercials
-
client
)

Choice
of
locations
and
their
proposed
use

Editorial
decisions
concerning
scene
coverage
and/or
documentary
content
(
my
late
mentor
Burleigh
Wartes
was
famous
for
cutting
films
in
the
camera
,
leaving
the
editor
of
record
tiny
little
handles
)

Supply
of
camera
,
lighting
,
and
grip
equipment
,
and
transportation
thereof
.

Choice
of
crew

Contracting
and
payment
of
crew
(
this
seems
to
be
diminishing
in
our
liability
loaded
world
)

So
the
diagram
which
would
show
all
this
would
have
a
bunch
of
amoeba-like
figures
encompassing
various
combinations
of
these
responsibilites
but
with
all
of
them
including
the
aesthetic
lighting
,
exposure
,
and
filtration
area
.

I
'm
sure
I
missed
a
bunch
,
and
I
know
a
list
is
not
a
definition
,
but
the
specifics
seem
to
vary
so
much
.

Mark
Weingartner

To
the
incredibly
extensive
and
comprehensive
list
I
would
add
,
simply
,
that
the
Cinematographer	B	Cinematographer	Cinematographer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer	000	000
(
I
still
prefer
that
title
,
as
opposed
to
the
Director	B	Director of PHotography	Cinematographer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer	000	000
of	I	Director of PHotography	Cinematographer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer	000	000
PHotography	I	Director of PHotography	Cinematographer	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer	000	000
,
which
underscores
the
Manager
aspect
of
the
job
,
but
not
the
artistic
)
is
the
visual
author
of
the
film
.

Yes
,
much
is
decided
by
the
director
,
etc.
,
but
if
the
director
's
job
is
to
tell
a
story
on
film
,
it
is
our
job
to
become
the
audience
's
eye
,
to
lead
or
retreat
,
hide
or
reveal
visual
elements
of
the
story
.

To
this
end
,
we
have
the
technos
of
our
craft
at
our
disposal
,
but
without
a
POINT
OF
VIEW
,
the
technique
is
empty
.

And
it
is
this
Point
of
View
that
makes
us
the
visual
author
of
the
film
.

Vittorio	B	Vittorio Storaro	Vittorio_Storaro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Storaro	000	000
Storaro	I	Vittorio Storaro	Vittorio_Storaro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Storaro	000	000
has
said
this
all
very
eloquently
before
,
to
which
I
'd
like
to
add
a
quote
from
Degas	B	Degas	Edgar_Degas	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Degas	000	000
:
"
One
reproduces
only
that
which
is
striking
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
necessary
.

Thus
one
's
recollections
and
invention
are
liberated
from
the
tyranny
which
nature
exerts
.
"

Even
when
we
approach
existing
light
circumstances
,
the
way
in
which
we
find
and
linger
on
specific
details
is
an
authoring
of
the
visual
world
,
which
is
where
the
art
begins
.

Thom
Harp

I
had
(
another
)
day
off
today
so
tried
to
answer
this
rugged
little
question

A
Director
of
Photography
's
duty
is
to
;

1
.

Design
the
photography
to
serve
your
director
's
plans
and
answer
the
stories
purpose
-
both
in
fidelity
with
the
best
traditions
of
the
craft
and
your
own
artistic
convictions
.

Learn
the
directors
personality
as
best
you
're
able
and
establish
a
common
photograhic
language
with
him
.

Understand
the
script
and
the
proposed
style
of
editing
.

2
.

Collaborate
with
fellow
dept.
heads
from
the
first
meeting
possible
.

Stay
apprised
of
the
developments
in
all
the
depts
.

that
will
directly
or
indirectly
effect
photography
,
set
function
and
set
efficiency
.

3
.

Pre-demonstrate
the
photographic
style
(
s
)
conclusively
from
film
tests
whenever
possible
.

Assess
that
the
photographic
design
equates
with
a
pragmatic
shooting
schedule
.

Be
abreast
of
the
release
plans
of
the
picture
,
of
likely
contingencies
and
plot
the
technology
routes
so
principle
photography
best
complies
with
the
final
release
objective
(
s
)
.

Integrate
a
plan
of
quality
control
and
consistency
with
the
lab
.

4
.

Sign
on
,
fit
out
and
command
the
camera
dept.
Be
accountable
for
all
action
within
the
dept
(
camera
,
lighting
and
grip
crews
)
Be
satisfied
that
all
crew
signed
on
to
the
production
within
these
depts
will
answer
to
the
skill
level
required
.

Oversee
the
logistic
preparedness
of
these
depts
.

5
.

Establish
the
tone
on
set
that
best
fits
your
working
style
.

(
i.e.insisting
that
the
set
is
turned
over
to
you
after
blocking
or
that
the
set
is
quiet
when
you
work
or
that
The
Clash
is
always
played
while
you
work
)
.

Lead
the
crew
by
example
and
ensure
a
healthy
work
place
that
is
safe
,
respectful
and
professional
(
encouraging
some
esprit
d'corps
is
a
valuable
service
to
all
)
.

Back
up
the
crew
and
if
needed
,
demand
the
above
conditions
prevail
.

Likewise
demand
that
the
crew
back
you
up
with
performance
.

6
.

Meet
the
schedule
.

Come
prepared
to
supply
the
celerity
and
raw
ingenuity
demanded
to
satisfy
your
artistic
want
of
truth
and
accuracy
.

Be
flexible
to
the
rapid
changes
of
physical
enviornment
and/or
the
director
's
priorities
.

Manuevre
the
mechanical
apparatus
and
personel
involved
to
keep
hitting
a
moving
target
.

7
.

Maintain
yourselfself
physically
with
rest
,
diet
and
regimen
to
keep
up
your
stamina
.

Be
attentive
to
the
effect
of
the
schedule
on
your
crew
and
represent
their
health
and
safety
conditions
to
production
if
neccessary
.

8
.

Make
do
with
what
you
have
.

9
.

Walk
your
pictures
through
the
post
production
phases
with
care
-
or
as
arranged
by
contract
and
schedule
.

To
me
it
boils
down
to
this
:

The
role
of
the
Director
of

in
audiovisial
production
is
to
assume
the
full
responsability
of
the
image
of
the
project
.

This
includes
two
main
resposabilities/tasks
:

1
.

To
be
the
first
man
next
to
the
director
in
interpreting
his
story
and
wishes
into
concrete
projected
moving
images
,
as
an
interpretor
,
as
close
as
possible
matching
the
CONTENTS
of
the
message
the
director
or
author
of
the
project
wants
to
communicate
.

(
this
is
the
creative
,
artistic
part
,
this
takes
feeling
and
talent
to
accomplish
)

2
.

To
assume
the
full
reponsability
over
the
technical
quality
of
this
image
(
upto
final
screening
if
allowed
to
)
(
this
is
the
techinical
;
quality
assurance
part
of
the
job
)

The
DP	B	DP	Management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management	000	000
,
in
order
to
achieve
these
goals
,
executes
concrete
tasks
described
before
in
this
thread
,
and
the
actions
to
take
may
vary
considerably
depending
on
the
needs
and
nature
of
the
project
and
the
DP	B	DP	Management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management	000	000
and
crew
themselves
.

They
always
boil
down
to
achieving
the
above
2
goals
however
.

My
2
cents

A
question
:
What
's
the
difference
between
a
DoP	B	DoP	Management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management	000	000
and
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
?

Answer
:
God
dose
n't
think
he
's
a
DoP

OK
,
OK
,
OK
-
do
n't
flame
me
.

It
was
a
joke
told
to
me
by
a
producer
friend
of
mine
.

It
could
just
have
easily
been
a
reference
to
a
director
,
producer
,
editor
,
etc.
.

Simon_Wicks

it
seems
everyone
is
defining
a
DP	B	DP	Management	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management	000	000
by
his
or
her
job
duties
and
not
by
their
artistic
role
.

as
pretentious
as
it
might
seem
,

Economic
reform
:
It
's
the
real
economy
,
stupid

The
exporting
sector
is
not
the
only
part
of
the
economy
that
needs
to
become
smart
if
Ireland
is
to
recover
,
says
Ronnie
O’Toole

It
was
the
Nobel	B	Nobel prize	Nobel_Prize	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize	000	000
prize	I	Nobel prize	Nobel_Prize	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize	000	000
winning
Paul	B	Paul Krugman	Paul_Krugman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman	000	000
Krugman	I	Paul Krugman	Paul_Krugman	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman	000	000
who
said
that
“
productivity
isn
’
t
everything
,
though
in
the
long
run
it
’
s
nearly
everything
.

A
country
’
s
ability
to
improve
its
standard
of
living
over
time
depends
almost
entirely
on
its
ability
to
raise
its
output
per
worker
.
”

He
said
that
in
1994
,
though
writing
in
2010
he
might
have
put
these
points
differently
.

In
the
short
-
run
,
productivity
does
little
to
solve
what
is
a
balance-sheet
recession
,
though
in
the
long
run
it
’
s
nearly
everything
.

A
country
’
s
ability
to
pay
back
its
debts
while
minimizing
the
fall
in
its
standard
of
living
depends
almost
entirely
on
its
ability
to
raise
its
output
per
worker
.

Productivity
is
once
again
moving
centre
stage
.

If
the
sovereign
debt
crisis
had
one
clear
positive
it
was
the
focus
it
started
to
place
on
growth
prospects
going
forward
.

Of
course
in
the
short
run
,
the
sheer
scale
of
retrenchment
which
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
is
being
forced
into
will
result
in
a
weaker
growth
than
would
have
otherwise
been
the
case
.

However
as
we
move
beyond
this
,
productivity
growth
will
again
take
over
as
the
primary
driver
of
welfare
.

This
is
where
the
Smart
Economy
debate
,
long
derided
as
a
wordy
PR	B	PR	Public_relations	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations	000	000
distraction
,
will
increase
in
relevance
.

What
’
s
disappointing
about
this
debate
is
that
up
to
now
it
has
focused
almost
entirely
on
exporting
firms
,
the
one
section
of
the
economy
that
is
already
demonstrably
smart
.

The
evidence
of
this
is
striking
.

In
a
research
paper
published
in
October
,
the
ECB	B	ECB	European_Central_Bank	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank	000	000
ranked
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
as
being
the
most
high-tech
exporting
country
,
far
outpacing
Austria	B	Austria	Austria	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria	000	000
and
Finland	B	Finland	Finland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland	000	000
in
second
and
third
place
respectively
.

The
other
countries
with
which
we
supposedly
share
so
many
similarities
,
namely
Greece	B	Greece	Greece	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece	000	000
and
Spain	B	Spain	Spain	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain	000	000
,
were
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
scale
.

In
the
space
of
twenty
years
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
has
moved
to
the
quality
end
of
the
export
spectrum
,
and
is
a
world
leader
in
pharmaceuticals
,
information
technology
and
services
.

However
the
debate
on
how
we
can
make
our
exporting
sector
smarter
has
continued
in
what
is
an
increasingly
redundant
debate
.

Many
of
these
issues
have
been
resolved
a
long
time
ago
.

Should
we
or
shouldn
’
t
have
an
active
industrial
policy
?

Answer
:
We
should
and
we
do
.

Should
we
turn
our
back
on
services
,
and
concentrate
on
manufacturing
?

Answer
:
No
we
should
n’t
,
nor
will
we
.

Why
then
do
policymakers
still
focus
on
exporters
?

The
reason
is
simple
.

Productivity
growth
destroys
as
it
creates
.

Improving
productivity
requires
out-dated
practices
to
be
swept
away
,
companies
to
transform
and
workers
to
re-skill
.

It
’s
difficult
,
often
unpopular
,
yet
crucial
for
long-run
economic
health
.

However
when
we
create
an
exporting
operation
in
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
,
the
pain
is
felt
elsewhere
.

Maybe
a
plant
gets
shut
in
Israel	B	Israel	Israel	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel	000	000
,
or
a
planned
expansion
in
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
is
cancelled
.

Do
you
think
that
when
the
Polish	B	Polish	Poland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland	000	000
Government
was
pitching
to
Dell	B	Dell	Dell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell	000	000
that
it
was
worried
about
the
job
losses
in
Limerick	B	Limerick	Limerick	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limerick	000	000
?

Of
course
not
.

Promoting
export
firms
is
a
one-way
bet
,
and
avoids
having
to
make
the
really
difficult
decisions
.

What
our
exporters
really
need
now
is
action
to
reduce
the
cost
of
operating
a
business
from
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
.

The
source
of
this
cost
is
the
sectors
which
sell
into
the
domestic
market
,
many
of
whom
are
anything
but
smart
.

This
is
not
just
another
jab
at
the
public
sector
.

Many
sectors
dominated
by
private
provision
in
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
remain
unreformed
,
inefficient
and
expensive
.

Reforming
these
sectors
will
be
difficult
,
and
the
benefits
aren
’
t
immediate
.

Reform
must
be
done
sector
by
sector
,
ensuring
that
regulation
promotes
competition
.

The
Government
itself
must
become
a
very
demanding
customer
for
local
services
through
its
procurement
practices
.

The
banking
sector
is
a
case
in
point
.

Banks
are
the
gatekeepers
for
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
’
s
payments
industry
,
the
means
by
which
we
as
a
society
pay
for
goods
and
services
.

Almost
uniquely
in
Europe	B	Europe	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
,
the
Irish	B	Irish	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
payments
industry
remains
dominated
by
paper
--
i.e.
cash
and
cheques
-
at
a
cost
of
$
1bn
annually
to
the
economy
.

The
cost
of
our
high
use
of
cash
and
cheques
goes
beyond
pure
financial
concerns
.

Wide-scale
cash
usage
helps
perpetuate
the
shadow
economy
,
at
a
considerable
cost
to
ordinary
,
compliant
taxpayers
.

Further
,
the
security
challenges
of
transporting
large
volumes
of
cash
are
needlessly
putting
the
lives
of
bank
,
retail
and
security
staff
at
risk
.

Finally
,
there
is
a
strong
correlation
between
a
country
’
s
use
of
cheques
and
the
problem
of
a
late
payments
culture
,
which
in
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
causes
huge
difficulties
for
SMEs	B	SMEs	Small_and_medium_enterprises	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium_enterprises	000	000
.

Of
course
the
payments
issue
is
just
one
example
of
many
.

The
recent
Forfás
report
,
“
Making
it
Happen
,
Growing
Enterprise
for
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
”
,
sets
out
the
range
of
actions
needed
to
stimulate
domestic
productivity
.

It
highlights
the
role
of
competition
policy
,
particularly
in
the
areas
of
legal
and
medical
services
,
where
costs
remain
very
high
despite
the
price
falls
in
the
rest
of
the
economy
.

They
also
highlight
public
procurement
as
an
area
which
needs
to
be
overhauled
.

Firms
react
to
the
demands
of
consumers
,
and
where
the
Government	B	Government	Government	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government	000	000
is
the
consumer
it
has
to
become
far
more
demanding
.

We
are
not
alone
in
this
need
to
tackle
structural
reforms
.

The
above
ECB	B	ECB	European_Central_Bank	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank	000	000
report
concluded
that
European	B	European	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
policymakers
have
been
using
the
strength
of
the
Euro	B	Euro	Euro	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro	000	000
as
an
excuse
for
Europe	B	Europe	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000

Chamber
officials
said
Wednesday
that
the
annual
dinner

audience
of
about
750
people
was
the
largest
in
the
Chamber
's
99-year

history
.

For
nearly
three
decades
,
the
Lafayettes
have
been
among
the

region
's
most
successful
entrepreneurs
.

As
leaders
in
the
hospitality
business
,
the
Lafayettes
built

an
impressive
chain
of
27
hotels
in
Maine	B	Maine	Maine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine	000	000
and
beyond
.

Their
Maine	B	Maine	Maine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine	000	000

holdings
include
the
Best
Western
Black
Bear
Inn
&
Conference

Center
in

.

Though
the
couple
quietly
had
been
sharing
the
proceeds
of

their
hotels
with
the
community
for
years
,
the
$
2
million
pledge
they

made
to
the
Champion
for
the
Cure	B	Cure	Cure	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cure	000	000
campaign
for
the
new
cancer
center

last
August
created
a
stir
throughout
northern
and
eastern
Maine	B	Maine	Maine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine	000	000
.

In

recognition
of
the
pledge
,
the
new
facility
was
named
the
Lafayette

Family
Cancer
Center
.

The
state-of-the-art
center
adjacent
to
the

Cianchette
Building
in
Brewer	B	Brewer	Brewer,_Maine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewer,_Maine	000	000
opened
last
month
.

The
new
center
replaced
the
former
Cancer
Care
of
Maine	B	Maine	Maine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine	000	000

facility
,
which
had
outgrown
its
former

Fundraising
continues
for

research
,
however
,
with
more

information
available
online
at
www.championthecure.org
.

In
accepting
the
Chamber
award
,
the
couple
said
they
were

motivated
to
act
because
their
own
family
has
been
touched
by
cancer
.

One
of
their
sons
,
Ramsey	B	Ramsey	Ramsey_County,_Minnesota	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_County,_Minnesota	000	000
,
now
23
,
was
diagnosed
with
cancer
at
age
18

and
has
beaten
the
disease
,
they
said
during
Wednesday
's
ceremony
.

They

said
they
believe
a
cure
will
be
found
,
and
the
an-swer
lies
in

research
.
"

Danny
and
I
and
our
family
are
very
fortunate
in
that
our
son

Ramsey	B	Ramsey	Ramsey_County,_Minnesota	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_County,_Minnesota	000	000
has
now
been
cancer-free
for
five
years
,
"
Carla
Lafayette
said

upon
receiving
the
award
.
"

Half
of
the
people
who
receive
the
same
diagnosis
that
he
did

--
stage
three
melanoma
--
no
longer
are
alive
today
.

That
sobering

statistic
needs
to
change
,
and
the
key
is
research
,
"
she
said
.
"

I
envision
a
day
when
we
share
a
characteristic
with
the

naked
mole
rat
,
"
which
she
said
has
been
found
never
to
develop
cancer
.
"

I
know
that
human
beings
are
smart
enough
to
figure
out
the
causes
of

and
cures
for
cancer
.

If
the
naked
mole
rat
can
get
it
right
,
we
can
.

Research
is
the
key
.

The
more
scientists
that
we
have
tack-ling
the

problem
,
the
sooner
solutions
will
be
found
.
"

During
his
turn
at
the
microphone
,
Danny
Lafayette
shared

ideas
for
making
the
region
a
better
place
in
which
to
live
and
work
--

chief
among
them
a
state-sponsored
medical
school
.

He
envisioned
the

school
as
a
joint
venture
of
the
University	B	University of Maine	University_of_Maine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maine	000	000
of	I	University of Maine	University_of_Maine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maine	000	000
Maine	I	University of Maine	University_of_Maine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maine	000	000
and
the
University	B	University of New England	University_of_New_England_(United_States)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_England_(United_States)	000	000
of	I	University of New England	University_of_New_England_(United_States)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_England_(United_States)	000	000
New	I	University of New England	University_of_New_England_(United_States)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_England_(United_States)	000	000
England	I	University of New England	University_of_New_England_(United_States)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_England_(United_States)	000	000
.
"

About
70
percent
of
doctors
practice
within
100
miles
of

where
they
attend
medical
school
,
"
he
said
,
adding
that
44
states
have

state-sponsored
or
private
medical
schools
,
34
states
have
dental

schools
,
47
have
at
least
one
pharmacy
school
and
29
states
have
all

three
.

He
applauded
Husson	B	Husson University	Husson_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husson_University	000	000
University	I	Husson University	Husson_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husson_University	000	000
's
recent
addition
of
a
pharmacy

program
.
"

It
's
obvious
that
it
's
a
good
investment
,
and
I
have
no
idea

why
we
do
n't
have
[
a
medical
school
]
at
the
University	B	University of Maine	University_of_Maine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maine	000	000
of	I	University of Maine	University_of_Maine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maine	000	000
Maine	I	University of Maine	University_of_Maine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maine	000	000
.

We

should
bond
it
just
like
we
do
a
road
.

plan

by

and
promoting
adventure
tourism
activities
.

Big
Sandy
Area
Development
Director
Sandy
Runyon
,
who
has
worked
with
local
leaders
to
establish
trail
systems
in
eastern
Kentucky	B	Kentucky	Eastern_Kentucky_Coal_Field_region	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Kentucky_Coal_Field_region	000	000
for
a
number
of
years
,

Owsley	B	Owsley	Owsley_County,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owsley_County,_Kentucky	000	000
and
Harlan	B	Harlan	Harlan,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan,_Kentucky	000	000
counties
have
worked
together
for
quite
some
time
to
develop
a
trail
system
that
would
attract
ATV	B	ATV	All-terrain_vehicle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-terrain_vehicle	000	000
riders
,
horse
enthusiasts
,
hikers
and
others
into
eastern
Kentucky	B	Kentucky	Eastern_Kentucky_Coal_Field_region	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Kentucky_Coal_Field_region	000	000
.

Runyon
explained
that
those
counties
have
entered
into
an
interlocal
agreement
regarding
the
trail
system
,
with
the
understanding
that
each
county
is
responsible
for
trail
development
and
maintenance
in
their
counties
.

Officials
in
these
counties
also
agree
that
counties
would
assist
each
other
with
maintenance
or
other
issues
on
neighboring
properties
,
with
the
understanding
that
counties
wo
n't
be
billed
for
that
service
and
with
goal
of
eventually
connecting
all
trails
together
in
one
large
system
.

The
Pike
County
Fiscal
Court
is
the
first
of
several
Big	B	Big Sandy	Big_Sandy_River_(Ohio_River)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sandy_River_(Ohio_River)	000	000
Sandy	I	Big Sandy	Big_Sandy_River_(Ohio_River)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sandy_River_(Ohio_River)	000	000
area
counties
to
become
a
part
of
the
initiative
by
passing
a
resolution
to
join
the
multi-county
effort
during
a
Nov.
1
meeting
.

Although
Pike	B	Pike county	Pike_County,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_County,_Kentucky	000	000
county	I	Pike county	Pike_County,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_County,_Kentucky	000	000
officials
talked
about
developing
a
trail
system
to
mimic
the
successful
Hatfield-McCoy
ATV
Trail
system
in
West	B	West Virginia	West_Virginia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia	000	000
Virginia	I	West Virginia	West_Virginia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia	000	000
,
Runyon
believes
the
interlocal
agreement
,
once
it
is
finalized
,
will
encompass
all
types
of
trails
and
trail-based
activities
.

The
first
step
is
for
Fiscal
Courts
in
those
counties
to
pass
a
resolution
stating
the
county
's
intent
on
participating
.

Thereafter
,
county
attorneys
will
hash
out
a
finalized
interlocal
agreement
that
suits
the
needs
of
all
counties
.

The
Big
Sandy
ADD
is
currently
preparing
resolutions
for
other
Big	B	Big Sandy	Big_Sandy_River_(Ohio_River)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sandy_River_(Ohio_River)	000	000
Sandy	I	Big Sandy	Big_Sandy_River_(Ohio_River)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sandy_River_(Ohio_River)	000	000
counties
.

“
I
'm
not
sure
how
many
counties
will
sign
on
,
”
Runyon
said
.

“
But
we
know
that
Pike	B	Pike	Northern_pike	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_pike	000	000
,
Floyd
,
Magoffin	B	Magoffin	Magoffin_County,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magoffin_County,_Kentucky	000	000
and
Martin
counties
are
interested
and
we
expect
that
Johnson	B	Johnson County	Johnson_County,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_County,_Kentucky	000	000
County	I	Johnson County	Johnson_County,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_County,_Kentucky	000	000
will
also
be
interested
.

Our
goal
is
to
have
any
kind
of
agreement
they
enter
into
to
include
all
trails
.
”

Once
the
interlocal
agreement
between
the
counties
is
finalized
,
Runyon
said
it
is
likely
that
individual
counties
will
be
responsible
for
obtaining
land-use
permits
from
residents
,
which
could
be
a
“
huge
endeavor
”
in
counties
like
Pike	B	Pike County	Pike_County,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_County,_Kentucky	000	000
County	I	Pike County	Pike_County,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_County,_Kentucky	000	000
,
where
officials
have
identified
200
property
owners
along
one
potential
trail
route
.

Runyon
said
the
biggest
issue
in
connecting
eastern
Kentucky	B	Kentucky	Eastern_Kentucky_Coal_Field_region	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Kentucky_Coal_Field_region	000	000
trails
is
the
liability
that
property
owners
face
when
they
allow
the
public
to
come
onto
their
property
.

There
has
been
some
effort
at
the
state
level
to
pass
legislation
to
ease
the
property
liability
burden
,
but
the
state
's
tort
law
,
allowing
people
to
sue
for
various
reasons
,
may
prevent
further
success
of
that
effort
.

One
bill
passed
the
House	B	House	United_States_House_of_Representatives	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives	000	000
last
year
,
but
it
died
without
a
vote
in
the
Senate	B	Senate	United_States_Senate	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate	000	000
.

Runyon
said
the
laws
enacted
by
the
legislature
show
progress
.

“
I
do
think
there
is
a
way
around
all
of
this
if
everybody
can
work
together
,
and
they
truly
do
work
together
,
and
try
to
add
all
the
needs
of
everybody
involved
,
”
she
said
.

“
I
think
we
can
make
some
progress
.
”

Areas
like
Harlan	B	Harlan	Harlan,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan,_Kentucky	000	000
,
Bell	B	Bell	Bell_County,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_County,_Kentucky	000	000
,
Knott
Leslie
and
Knott	B	Knott	Knott_County,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knott_County,_Kentucky	000	000
counties
found
ways
around
the
liability
issues
and
are
able
to
market
trails
and
host
large-scale
trail
events
because
a
large
corporate
landowner
or
private
landowners
with
large
,
usable
tracks
of
property
provided
a
long-term
lease
to
the
county
.

“
Bell	B	Bell County	Bell_County,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_County,_Kentucky	000	000
County	I	Bell County	Bell_County,_Kentucky	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_County,_Kentucky	000	000
is
the
new
kid
on
the
block
,
”
Runyon
said
.

“
There
was
a
company
there
that
leased
7,600
acres
to
the
county
.

They
held
an
ATV	B	ATV	All-terrain_vehicle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-terrain_vehicle	000	000
event
there
three
weeks
ago
that
attracted
3,000
riders
.

So
,
it
's
possible
to
do
this
.
”

Runyon
said
the
local
residents
contacted
by
the
Big
Sandy
ADD
have
reported
that
they
are
excited
about
the
potential
.

“
The
only
resistance
we
see
is
the
unknown
,
”
she
said
.

“
If
every
county
develops
a
block
of
property
and
show
the
locals
that
it
will
work
,
that
people
will
come
in
here
to
ride
these
trails
and
there
is
economic
benefit
to
that
,
then
I
think
local
landowners
will
want
to
get
involved
.
”

She
is
asking
all
counties
to
assess
properties
that
might
be
available
for
trail
development
.

The
multi-county
coalition
will
make
the
region
more
eligible
to
receive
multi-county
coal
severance
tax
funds
and
grant
funding
for
trail
development
projects
,
Runyon
explained
.

“
We
truly
believe
here
that
tourism
will
be
an
economic
development
engine
,
”
Runyon
said
.

“
It
wo
n't
be
the
only
engine
,
but
it
will
be
a
major
economic
tool
for
this
region
.

Duluth	B	Duluth	Duluth,_Minnesota	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth,_Minnesota	000	000
into
an

They
have
been
able
to

up
plenty
of

hope
their
fast
offense
will
overpower

defense
.

MSU
Moorhead
is
neck-and-neck
with
Concordia	B	Concordia	Concordia_Stingers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordia_Stingers	000	000
in
receiving
points
for
the
national
poll
but
not
yet
taking
in
a
top-25
ranking
.

Both
squads
will
aim
to
keep
their
season
undefeated
on
Saturday
night
.

The
Dragons	B	Dragons	St._George_Illawarra_Dragons	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Illawarra_Dragons	000	000
look

Bears	I	Golden Bears	Kutztown_Golden_Bears	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutztown_Golden_Bears	000	000
,
with
the
majority
of
their
scoring
and
defense
coming
from
post
players
.

CU	B	CU	University_of_Colorado	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado	000	000
and
MSUM	B	MSUM	Minnesota_State_University_Moorhead	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_State_University_Moorhead	000	000

two
leading

low
with
their
bigs
.

MSUM	B	MSUM	Minnesota_State_University_Moorhead	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_State_University_Moorhead	000	000
leads
the
NSIC	B	NSIC	Northern_Sun_Intercollegiate_Conference	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Sun_Intercollegiate_Conference	000	000
in
rebounding
and
has
used
shot
blocking
to
stifle
opponent
shooting
,
limiting
them
to
30.1
%
.

Concordia	B	Concordia	Concordia_Stingers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordia_Stingers	000	000
hopes
to
attack
MSUM	B	MSUM	Minnesota_State_University_Moorhead	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_State_University_Moorhead	000	000
before
they
have
a
chance
to
use
their
posts
,
expecting
a
full
court
press
and
on-ball
pressure
to
take
the
advantage
in
the
game
.

If
the
finals
were
played
today

August
20th
2006
07:39

West
Coast
v
Fremantle
(
Subiaco
Oval
)

Would
n't
this
be
something
to
salivate
for
Western	B	Western Australian	Western_Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia	000	000
Australian	I	Western Australian	Western_Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia	000	000
football
fans
,
arguably
the
two
form
sides
in
the
competition
,
and
perhaps
we
will
get
a
sneak
preview
of
what
is
to
come
in
September
next
Sunday
.

Adelaide
v
Melbourne
(
AAMI
Stadium
)

The
Crows	B	Crows	Adelaide_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Football_Club	000	000
are
struggling
,
no
matter
how
much
Neil	B	Neil Craig	Neil_Craig	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Craig	000	000
Craig	I	Neil Craig	Neil_Craig	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Craig	000	000
and
the
match
committee
try
to
hide
from
it
,
the
cold
hard
facts
are
there
.

Adelaide	B	Adelaide	Adelaide_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Football_Club	000	000
have
lost
three
of
their
past
four
,
were
lucky
to
get
away
with
the
points
against
the
Magpies	B	Magpies	Collingwood_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collingwood_Football_Club	000	000
a
fortnight
ago
on
their
own
home
ground
and
surrendered
a
five-goal
lead
to
the
Bulldogs	B	Bulldogs	Canterbury-Bankstown_Bulldogs	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury-Bankstown_Bulldogs	000	000
yesterday
.

The
Demons	B	Demons	Melbourne_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Football_Club	000	000
returned
to
their
best
today
at
the
G	B	G	Goal_(ice_hockey)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(ice_hockey)	000	000
,
and
represent
the
great
white
hope
of
Victorian	B	Victorian	Victoria_(Australia)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)	000	000
football
.

On
their
day
and
when
they
are
playing
as
a
team
are
as
good
as
anyone
in
the
competition
.

Injuries
to
Rivers
and
Bate	B	Bate	FC_BATE_Borisov	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_BATE_Borisov	000	000
could
prove
costly
,
but
with
Pickett
to
return
from
a
hamstring
injury
and
Robertson
and
Davey
to
be
better
for
the
run
today
,
the
Dees	B	Dees	Melbourne_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Football_Club	000	000
represent
a
big
danger
.

Sydney
v
Western
Bulldogs
(
SCG
)

The
Swans	B	Swans	Sydney_Swans	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Swans	000	000
were
disappointing
at
Skilled	B	Skilled Stadium	Kardinia_Park_(stadium)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardinia_Park_(stadium)	000	000
Stadium	I	Skilled Stadium	Kardinia_Park_(stadium)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardinia_Park_(stadium)	000	000
yesterday
and
blew
a
golden
opportunity
to
cement
a
spot
in
the
top
four
,
was
it
a
minor
abberation
,
we
'
lll
soon
see
.

The
Doggies	B	Doggies	Canterbury-Bankstown_Bulldogs	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury-Bankstown_Bulldogs	000	000
were
extremely
impressive
yesterday
against
the
Crows	B	Crows	Adelaide_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Football_Club	000	000
and
like
the
Dees	B	Dees	Melbourne_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Football_Club	000	000
are
capable
of
knocking
any
side
off
if
they
back
their
running
brand
of
football
.

Collingwood
v
St
Kilda
(
MCG
)

The
Pies	B	Pies	Collingwood_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collingwood_Football_Club	000	000
got
out
of
jail
against
Port	B	Port	Port	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port	000	000
at
AAMI	B	AAMI	Football_Park	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Park	000	000
on
Friday
night
,
while
the
Saints	B	Saints	St._George_Illawarra_Dragons	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Illawarra_Dragons	000	000
were
bitterly
disappointing
in
their
58-point
drubbing
at
the
hands
of
Fremantle	B	Fremantle	Fremantle_Football_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremantle_Football_Club	000	000
.

The
Saints	B	Saints	St._George_Illawarra_Dragons	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._George_Illawarra_Dragons	000	000
clearly
lack
pace
through
the
midfield
and
have
a
rising
injury
toll
and
doubts
over
whether
or
not
Aaron	B	Aaron Hamill	Aaron_Hamill	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Hamill	000	000
Hamill	I	Aaron Hamill	Aaron_Hamill	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Hamill	000	000
will
return
.

Even
if
he
does
you
would
expect
him
to
struggle
given
the
amount
of
football
he
has
missed
.

Hard
to
pick
a
winner
in
this
one
,
with
neither
side
being
in
particularly
good
form
in
recent
weeks
.

This
seasonal
incident
and
its
accompanying
rains
are
both
a
blessing
and
a
bane
to
the
Indian	B	Indian Subcontinent	Indian_subcontinent	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent	000	000
Subcontinent	I	Indian Subcontinent	Indian_subcontinent	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent	000	000
,
whose
largely
agricultural
workforce
depends
on
the
monsoon
for
approximately
90
percent
of
its
water
supply
.

“
Too
much
rain
,
or
too
little
,
”
says
BBC	B	BBC	BBC	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC	000	000
meteorologist
Bill
Giles
,
“
means
the
difference
between
flood
and
famine
.
”

One
Gospel
for
Asia
correspondent
reported
on
what
“
too
much
”
looked
like
to
a
GFA
survey
team
in
one
devastated
region
of
Central
India
:

“
Thousands
of
people
dead
,
families
rendered
homeless
as
their
houses
were
swept
away
,
cattle
drowned
,
crops
totally
rooted
out
,
villages
submerged
under
the
flood
waters-and
electricity
,
drinking
water
and
communications
systems
totally
failed
.
”

The
floods
have
affected
an
especially
large
region
of
the
country
this
year
,
stretching
from
Gujurat	B	Gujurat	Gujarat	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat	000	000
in
the

to
Nagaland	B	Nagaland	Nagaland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagaland	000	000

Rajasthan

India	B	India	India	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India	000	000
’s
western
state
of
Rajasthan	B	Rajasthan	Rajasthan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan	000	000
is
known
for
its
deserts
,
but
over
the
last
two
weeks
,
vast
areas
of
this
region
have
been
flooded
.

In
a
three-day
period
,
Barmar
district
near
Pakistan	B	Pakistan	Pakistan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan	000	000
received
22.7
inches
(
57.7
cm
)
of
rain
--
more
than
double
its
annual
average
.

Over
800,000
in
this
region
alone
have
been
affected
by
the
floods
.

Assam

This
northeast
Indian	B	Indian	Indian_subcontinent	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent	000	000
state
forms
a
large
part
of
the
drainage
system

the
massive
Brahmaputra	B	Brahmaputra River	Brahmaputra_River	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmaputra_River	000	000
River	I	Brahmaputra River	Brahmaputra_River	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmaputra_River	000	000
and
its
tributaries
,
which
in
flood
stage
often
cut
villages
off
from
transportation
,
electricity
and
phone
communication
for
weeks
.

“
Normal
life
in
these
areas
has
been
greatly
affected
,
”
said
a
GFA	B	GFA	Gospel_for_Asia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_for_Asia	000	000
field
correspondent
,
who
reported
that
hundreds
of
pastors

church
members
suffered
heavy
damage
and
property
loss
.

“
We

Gujarat

Water
covered
up

,
Gujarat	B	Gujarat	Gujarat	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat	000	000
’s
“
Diamond
City
,
”
and
affected
an
estimated
3.2
million
people
as
a
result
of
the
heavy
rains
that
fell
in
August
.

Much
of
the
state
is
still
under
the
threat
of
flooding
,
with
several
rivers
at
or
above
flood
stage
.

Maharashtra

Flash
floods
in
this
state
swept
away
sections
of
railway
line
,
submerged
bridges
and
closed
major
highways
.

Low-lying
areas
in
cities
such
as
Nagpur	B	Nagpur	Nagpur	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur	000	000
and
Mumbai	B	Mumbai	Mumbai	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai	000	000
were
also
affected
,
especially
bringing
suffering
to
the
slum-dwellers
and
others
with
already
inadequate
shelter
.

Some
homes
,
saturated
with
water
,
have
collapsed
,
killing
the
residents
inside
.

Andhra
Pradesh

The
consequences
of
the
heavy
rainfall
severely
impacted
residents
in
thousands
of
villages
in
this
state
.

With
water
levels
in
reservoirs
rising
dangerously
,
officials
were
forced
to
release
millions
of
gallons
of
water
into
the
already
flooded
rivers
.

Then
,
a
tropical
depression
that
formed
in
the
Bay	B	Bay of Bengal	Bay_of_Bengal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal	000	000
of	I	Bay of Bengal	Bay_of_Bengal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal	000	000
Bengal	I	Bay of Bengal	Bay_of_Bengal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal	000	000
caused
more
heavy
rainfall
for
four
straight
days
.

Two
Koya
tribal
villages
were
completely
wiped
out
when
the
Sabari
and
Seeleru
Rivers
rose
12
feet
above
their
banks
and
swept
through
the
communities
.

Villagers
ran
for
a
nearby
hill
as
the
rivers
washed
away
their
belongings
and
completely
destroyed
all
260
mud-and-bamboo
homes
.

They
waited
for
two
days
,
without
food
or
water
,
before
aid
arrived
.

Madhya
Pradesh

Some
villagers
were
stranded
after
floods
cut
them
off
from
roads
and
nearby
towns
.

The
city
of
Bhopal	B	Bhopal	Bhopal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal	000	000
experienced
rainfall
of
35.4
inches
(
90
cm
)
in
just
one
night
,
breaking
a
record
of
30.31
inches
(
77
cm
)
set
in
1973
.

A
girl
was
killed
and
six
people
injured
when
a
tree
fell
on
the
group
due
to
the
heavy
rains
.

Chhattisgarh

Widespread
rainfall
has
pounded
the
state
and
flood
waters
have
overflowed
at
least
one
dam
,
causing
further
flooding
downstream
.

In
one
district
,
60
houses
were
completely
isolated
by
the
waters
.

Orissa

The
threat
of
more
rain
came
from
the
same
tropical
depression
affecting
Andhra	B	Andhra Pradesh	Andhra_Pradesh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh	000	000
Pradesh	I	Andhra Pradesh	Andhra_Pradesh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh	000	000
,
and
fishermen
were
cautioned
to
remain
at
home
due
to
dangerously
rough
seas
.

Several
rivers
overflowed
their
banks
and
inundated
large
areas
,
and
one
city
recorded
rainfall
of
6.7
inches
(
17
cm
)
in
a
24-hour
period
.

Jammu
&
Kashmir

A
mountainous
state
,
Jammu	B	Jammu & Kashmir	Jammu_and_Kashmir	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir	000	000
&	I	Jammu & Kashmir	Jammu_and_Kashmir	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir	000	000
Kashmir	I	Jammu & Kashmir	Jammu_and_Kashmir	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir	000	000
has
not
only
experienced
its
share
of
floods
,
but
landslides
as
well
.

As
a
result
,
residents
faced
transportation
problems
with
stretches
of
highway
either
being
under
water
,
blocked
or
caved
in
.

Twenty
deaths
were
reported
in
the
state
,
primarily
from
houses
collapsing
,
and
thousands
of
other
homes
were
damaged
.

Monsoon
Predictable
?

To
a
Point

The
word
“
monsoon
”
comes
from
an
Arabic	B	Arabic	Arabic_language	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language	000	000
word
meaning
“
season
,
”
and
was
first
used
in
the
16th
century
by
Portuguese	B	Portuguese	Portugal	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal	000	000
and
Dutch	B	Dutch	Netherlands	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands	000	000
traders
sailing
the
spice
route
to
India	B	India	India	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India	000	000
.

It
refers
to
the
seasonal
wind
pattern
change
that
occurs
over
the
Subcontinent
:
First
,
the
land
heats
up
during
the
first
months
of
the
year
;
then
,
as
the
hot
air
rises
,
moist
air
from
the
Indian	B	Indian Ocean	Indian_Ocean	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean	000	000
Ocean	I	Indian Ocean	Indian_Ocean	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean	000	000
blows
in
from
the
southwest
to
take
its
place
,
bringing
heavy
rainfall
.

Rains
from
the
yearly
Southwest	B	Southwest Monsoon	Monsoon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon	000	000
Monsoon	I	Southwest Monsoon	Monsoon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon	000	000
generally
begin
in
southern
India	B	India	India	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India	000	000
around
June
1
and
spread
northwest
through
June
and
July
.

The
rains
start
to
abate
from
the
northwest
in
September
and
retreat
to
the
southeast
,
leaving
the
Subcontinent	B	Subcontinent	Indian_subcontinent	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent	000	000
around
the
middle
of
October
.

But
though
the
arrival
and
departure
of
the
monsoon
season
can
be
forecast
relatively
accurately
,
what
is
not
predictable
each
year
is
the
intensity
of
the
rainfall
.

This
has
been
the
case
for
the
2006
monsoon
,
which
has
caused
the
loss
of
more
than
2,000
lives
and
the
displacement
of
millions
all
across
the
nation
of
India	B	India	India	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India	000	000

Conventional
wisdom
has
it
that
international
terrorism
is
biggest
enemy
of
peace
today
.

But
when
attempting
to
define
terrorism
,
forget
the
stereotype
of
a
masked
bomber
.

In
Lebanon	B	Lebanon	Lebanon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon	000	000
,
for
instance
,
Hezbollah	B	Hezbollah	Hezbollah	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah	000	000
is
a
recognized
political
party
whose
members
have
been
elected
to
the
Lebanese	B	Lebanese Parliament	Parliament_of_Lebanon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Lebanon	000	000
Parliament	I	Lebanese Parliament	Parliament_of_Lebanon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Lebanon	000	000
in
a
free
and
open
election
,
yet
such
world
powers
as
the
United	B	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
States	I	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
and
Britain	B	Britain	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
label
it
as
a
terrorist
organization
.

Carr
,
a
British	B	British	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
journalist
and
broadcaster
,
ranges
back
in
time
to
the
1880s
to
profile
the
history
of
terrorism
.

Included
in
this
narrative
sweep
are
the
attack
by
Russian	B	Russian	Russia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia	000	000
revolutionaries
upon
Tsar	B	Tsar Alexander II	Alexander_II_of_Russia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Russia	000	000
Alexander	I	Tsar Alexander II	Alexander_II_of_Russia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Russia	000	000
II	I	Tsar Alexander II	Alexander_II_of_Russia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_II_of_Russia	000	000
in
St.	B	St. Petersburg	Saint_Petersburg	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg	000	000
Petersburg	I	St. Petersburg	Saint_Petersburg	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg	000	000
,
the
African	B	African	Africa	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa	000	000
vengeance
of
the
Mau
Maus
,
the
Palestine	B	Palestine Liberation Organization	Palestine_Liberation_Organization	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization	000	000
Liberation	I	Palestine Liberation Organization	Palestine_Liberation_Organization	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization	000	000
Organization	I	Palestine Liberation Organization	Palestine_Liberation_Organization	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization	000	000
,
Basque	B	Basque	Basque_people	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_people	000	000
separatists
and
Ireland	B	Ireland	Republic_of_Ireland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland	000	000
's
IRA	B	IRA	Irish_Republican_Army	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army	000	000
.

Rather
than
merely
hanging
labels
around
the
necks
of
one
's
political
enemies
,
Carr
believes
it
's
more
useful
to
examine
the
root
causes
of
terrorism
.
"

The
present
eruption
of
Islamist	B	Islamist	Islam	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam	000	000
violence
is
perhaps
a
symptom
of
an
imbalance
of
power
,
"
he
says
,
"
and
the
consequence
of
decades
of
manipulation
,
deceit
and
hypocrisy
in
Western	B	Western	Western_world	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world	000	000
foreign
policy
towards
the
Arab	B	Arab	Arab_people	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people	000	000
world
.
"

This
is
a
work
unlikely
to
show
up
on
George	B	George W. Bush	George_W._Bush	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush	000	000
W.	I	George W. Bush	George_W._Bush	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush	000	000

Professional
Ethics

Sunday

The
ability
to
recognize
and
respond
appropriately
to
ethical
dilemmas
encountered
while
treating
addictive
disorders
is
a
complex
task
that
can
not
be
taken
for
granted
by
even
experienced
counselors
.

Full
caseloads
and
busy
schedules
provide
few
opportunities
for
in-depth
examinations
of
ethical
dilemmas
that
often
demand
an
on-the-spot
decision
.

This
article
sets
forth
a
pragmatic
set
of
principles
that
can
help
counselors
to
evaluate
ethically
challenging
situations
.

While
these
ethical
principles
are
relevant
to
almost
any
counseling
situation
,
this
article
focuses
on
how
they
apply
to
the
treatment
of
substance
and
behavioral
addictions
.

Numerous
written
codes
of
ethical
conduct
exist
to
guide
the
many
different
counseling
professions
.

These
documents
may
be
more
useful
for
giving
clients
and
the
public
an
assurance
of
the
ethical
parameters
of
professional
behavior
than
in
providing
counselors
with
a
useful
frame
of
reference
for
dealing
with
day-to-day
dilemmas
.

There
is
also
an
important
difference
between
merely
abiding
by
rules
of
conduct
and
embodying
the
ideals
contained
within
them
(
Coale
,
1998
;
Tjeltveit
,
1999
)
.

A
set
of
common
principles
derived
from
these
various
codes
must
be
sufficiently
broad
enough
to
take
into
account
the
rich
variety
of
practice
settings
,
counseling
theories
and
treatment
approaches
in
which
addiction
counselors
operate
.

Any
less
inclusive
formula
for
determining
whether
a
counselor
's
behavior
is
ethically
appropriate
requires
knowledge
of
the
context
in
which
it
occurs
.

For
example
,
vigorously
challenging
a
client
's
beliefs
or
behaviors
may
be
ethically
justifiable
under
one
set
of
circumstances
but
not
another
(
Tjeltveit
,
1999
)
.

Similarly
,
different
counselors
may
respond
to
an
identical
ethical
dilemma
in
very
distinct
yet
equally
justifiable
ways
.

What
follows
are
six
core
ethical
guidelines
that
are
sufficiently
broad
and
context-free
to
serve
as
a
useful
frame
of
reference
in
day-to-day
counseling
practice
.

These
six
guidelines
are
to
provide
informed
consent
;
operate
in
a
competent
and
theoretically
sound
manner
;
insure
confidentiality
of
client
information
;
maintain
appropriate
relationship
boundaries
;
utilize
adequate
consultation
;
and
to
honor
diverse
personal
and
cultural
values
(
Corey
et
al.
,
1998
)
.

Informed
consent

Informed
consent
is
the
fundamental
bedrock
of
ethical
practice
,
because
it
helps
to
solidify
the
client
's
autonomy
in
matters
that
affect
the
entire
course
and
direction
of
counseling
.

Counselors
may
not
always
fully
appreciate
the
lengths
they
must
go
to
in
order
to
ensure
that
important
decisions
about
treatment
issues
are
truly
made
from
a
basis
of
informed
choice
.

Rather
than
being
a
one-time
event
,
informed
consent
is
an
on-going
collaborative
effort
between
client
and
counselor
for
establishing
and
continuously
monitoring
the
goals
and
strategies
of
counseling
as
well
as
the
roles
,
rights
,
and
responsibilities
of
all
parties
(
Tjeltveit
,
1999
)
.

A
client
has
a
right
to
know
which
treatment
modalities
an
addiction
counselor
typically
recommends
,
such
as
group
therapy
,
couples
therapy
,
family
therapy
,
medication
,
support
group
attendance
,
and
so
forth
.

Counselors
often
do
n't
take
the
time
to
explicitly
discuss
the
expected
benefits
and
potential
risks
of
their
services
,
as
well
as
any
alternative
treatment
approaches
that
may
be
available
to
the
client
.

Informed
consent
also
includes
information
about
the
anticipated
duration
of
treatment
and
any
situations
that
could
result
in
a
counselor
prematurely
terminating
services
.

In
addition
,
clients
should
know
the
policy
for
resolving
disputes
as
well
as
all
pertinent
financial
aspects
of
the
counseling
relationship
;
counselors
should
also
be
open
to
discussing
their
background
and
theoretical
orientation
(
Houston	B	Houston	Houston	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston	000	000
-
Vega	B	Vega	Greeks_(finance)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance)	000	000
and
Nuehring
,
1997
)
.

Due
to
the
large
volume
this
information
may
constitute
,
the
counselor
may
choose
to
convey
it
by
a
combination
of
verbal
and
written
means
.

A
client
's
informed
consent
is
not
in
itself
sufficient
to
determine
whether
a
counselor
's
behavior
is
ethical
.

It
's
conceivable
that
clients
might
be
willing
to
give
their
approval
to
any
number
of
ethically
inappropriate
behaviors
,
so
a
counselor
needs
other
core
principles
to
guide
the
ethical
decision-making
process
.

Competence
and
established
theory

A
counselor
has
an
ethical
responsibility
to
practice
only
within
the
scope
of
his
or
her
professional
competence
.

Some
typical
indicators
of
competence
include
education
,
experience
,
training
,
and
certification
(
Pope	B	Pope	Pope	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope	000	000
and
Vasquez
,
1998
)
.

Competence
in
one
clinical
area
does
n't
necessarily
translate
to
another
.

Counselors
with
extensive
experience
treating
general
psychiatric
disorders
are
n't
necessarily
competent
to
meet
the
specific
needs
of
addicted
clients
,
just
as
addiction
counselors
without
advanced
training
do
n't
always
adequately
recognize
signs
of
psychiatric
disorders
.

Cross-referral
between
such
specialists
is
necessary
in
such
situations
.

One
often-overlooked
component
of
competency
is
a
counselor
's
ability
to
clearly
describe
the
theoretical
basis
for
providing
a
particular
clinical
service
.

Just
because
a
client
's
case
turned
out
all
right
does
n't
necessarily
justify
a
counselor
's
actions
if
they
otherwise
lack
adequate
theoretical
support
.

It
is
important
to
do
the
right
thing
for
the
right
reason
,
not
just
for
the
right
result
.

Counselors
operating
without
the
benefit
of
a
clear
theory
are
likely
to
rely
too
much
on
a
combination
of
intuition
,
habit
,
consensus
and
personal
preference
(
Herring	B	Herring	Herring	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herring	000	000
,
2001
;
Tjeltveit
,
1999
;
Corey
et
al.
,
1998
)
.

Clients
deserve
the
knowledge
and
right
to
accept
or
reject
treatment
that
represents
a
particular
theoretical
orientation
.

In
the
absence
of
information
to
the
contrary
,
clients
will
assume
that
whatever
form
of
counseling
they
are
receiving
is
the
only
available
or
appropriate
choice
.

Confidentiality

Another
core
ethical
principle
is
for
a
counselor
to
vigilantly
guard
against
unauthorized
disclosure
of
client
information
.

The
assurance
of
confidentiality
is
a
fundamental
guarantee
,
but
it
is
not
an
absolute
one
.

Several
ethical
dilemmas
involving
confidentiality
commonly
arise
in
the
treatment
of
addictive
disorders
:

Duty
to
Warn/Protect
.

It
is
widely
accepted
that
counselors
have
a
general
obligation
to
warn
or
protect
people
whom
a
client
places
in
imminent
harm
.

The
right
to
confidential
treatment
is
therefore
balanced
by
the
need
to
ensure
the
safety
of
others
.

The
beginning
of
the
counseling
relationship
is
the
most
appropriate
time
for
a
client
to
learn
about
these
limits
of
confidentiality
as
well
as
any
safeguards
necessary
to
protect
others
,
such
as
policies
on
notifying
law
enforcement
personnel
if
a
habitual
DUI	B	DUI	Driving_under_the_influence	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_under_the_influence	000	000

drives

a
counseling
appointment
while
apparently
intoxicated
.

Clients
who
inject
drugs
or
engage
in
sexually
risky
behavior
while
chemically
impaired
may
expose
others
to
the
risk
of
HIV
infection
.

Courts
have
not
generally
applied
duty-to-warn
standards
to
these
situations
(
Houston	B	Houston	Houston	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston	000	000
-

and

)
.

Balancing
the
counselor-client
relationship
with
the
protection
of
at-risk
populations
is
a
very
complex
and
emotionally
charged
situation
.

Counselors
should
inform
clients
about
their
policy
for
dealing
with
HIV	B	HIV	HIV	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV	000	000
-
related
confidentiality
issues
,
educate
clients
about
the
health
risks
of
their
specific
sex
and
drug
practices
,
communicate
any
concerns
that
arise
during
the
course
of
treatment
,
offer
to
help
communicate
information
to
partners
,
and
consult
with
colleagues
as
deemed
appropriate
.

Minors
and
Families
.

All
states
require
counselors
to
report
situations
in
which
minors
are
in
danger
of
harm
,
although
specific
state
statutes
differ
(
Corey
et
al.
,
1998
)
.

As
most
counselors
know
,
it
can
be
difficult
to
distinguish
potential
from
probable
risk
.

For
instance
,
a
client
who
admits
to
blackouts
may
deny
that
she
places
her
children
in
any
danger
.

A
counselor
who
decides
not
to
notify
the
designated
reporting
agency
in
such
a
situation
should
document
the
basis
for
this
decision
in
the
clinical
record
.

Consultation
in
these
situations
is
again
extremely
valuable
in
helping
a
counselor
maintain
much-needed
clinical
objectivity
.

Counselors
who
treat
minors
for
substance
use
disorders
need
to
clearly
establish
the
extent
to
which
parents
have
the
right
to
information
that
is
disclosed
by
their
children
.

A
minor
may
be
reluctant
to
talk
honestly
if
confidentiality
boundaries
are
not
clear
,
and
the
therapeutic
alliance
may
be
crippled
if
a
counselor
who
is
unclear
on
the
limits
of
confidentiality
later
provides
information
to
parents
.

Counselors
should
be
familiar
with
federal
law
on
confidentiality
of
alcohol
and
drug
abuse
records
for
minor
clients
(
Confidentiality
of
Alcohol
and
Drug
Abuse
Patient
Records
,
1998
)
as
well
as
any
applicable
state
laws
,
and
should
seek
professional
consultation
whenever
questions
arise
.

A
major
ethical
concern
that
arises
when
counseling
couples
or
families
is
how
to
deal
with
the
emergence
of
secrets
that
so
often
accompany
addictive
disorders
.

For
example
,
consider
the
situation
that
could
arise
when
providing
marital
counseling
to
a
couple
if
a
husband
who
attends
a
session
by
himself
announces
that
he
's
relapsed
on
cocaine
but
is
unwilling
to
admit
this
to
his
wife
.

A
counselor
who
keeps
this
information
secret
is
not
fostering
a
climate
of
honesty
.

On
the
other
hand
,
revealing
information
that
a
client
reasonably
presumed
would
remain
confidential
will
damage
that
client
's
trust
,
while
threatening
to
summarily
end
treatment
if
the
client
is
n't
honest
with
his
spouse
is
a
form
of
coercion
and
potential
abandonment
.

This
again
points
to
the
necessity
of
informed
consent
:
whatever
approach
a
counselor
takes
in
response
to
these
types
of
situations
needs
to
be
thoroughly
discussed
at
the
beginning
of
the
counseling
relationship
so
that
all
clients
are
aware
of
the
consequences
of
disclosure
(
Corey
et
al.
,
1998
;
Herring	B	Herring	Herring	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herring	000	000
,
2001
)
.

Maintaining
appropriate
boundaries

The
next
core
concept
of
ethical
counseling
involves
the
complex
area
of
maintaining
appropriate
professional
boundaries
.

Most
counselors
know
that
there
are
ethical
risks
to
developing
relationships
outside
of
the
therapeutic
role
,
such
as
counseling
a
friend
or
pursuing
business
or
social
interactions
with
clients
.

These
types
of
dual
relationships
can
impair
a
counselor
's
objectivity
or
unintentionally
exploit
a
client
's
dependence
(
Pope	B	Pope	Pope	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope	000	000
and
Vasquez
,
1998
)
.

Yet
some
subtle
boundary
issues
present
ethical
dilemmas
that
are
neither
obvious
nor
easily
avoidable
.

Counselor
self-disclosure
.

In
order
to
maintain
appropriate
clarity
of
roles
,
a
counselor
should
only
reveal
intimate
personal
information
when
doing
so
is
clearly
relevant
to
the
client
's
treatment
goals
,
carefully
tailoring
this
information
to
the
client
and
paying
close
attention
to
how
such
sharing
affects
the
clinical
relationship
(
Bloomgarden
,
2000
)
.

Consultation
with
colleagues
and
supervisors
can
help
insure
that
the
true
purpose
for
disclosing
personal
information
is
to
meet
the
emotional
needs
of
the
client
rather
than
the
counselor
.

One
helpful
guideline
is
for
a
counselor
to
reveal
information
about
a
personal
life
problem
only
well
after
it
has
been
resolved
,
and
not
while
it
is
an
ongoing
issue
(
Hunter	B	Hunter	Hunting	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting	000	000
and
Struve
,
1998
)
.

Touch	B	Touch	IPod_Touch	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch	000	000
.

Since
a
significant
proportion
of
clients
with
addictive
disorders
have
a
history
of
childhood
trauma
(
Briere
,
1992
)
,
even
a
simple
act
of
touch
can
convey
a
variety
of
ethically
ambiguous
messages
.

The
history
of
addiction
support
is
replete
with
reassuring
hugs
.

It
's
very
important
for
a
counselor
who
engages
in
any
form
of
physical
contact
with
clients
to
have
a
highly
developed
sense
of
boundaries
and
an
astute
awareness
of
the
clinical
implications
of
this
behavior
.

The
initial
stages
of
the
therapeutic
relationship
may
not
provide
sufficient
emotional
safety
to
ensure
that
a
client
can
discuss
any
uncomfortable
feelings
involving
the
counselor
's
touch
(
Hunter	B	Hunter	Hunting	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting	000	000
and
Struve
,
1998
)
.

Sexual
attraction
.

Sexual
involvement
with
a
client
constitutes
a
profound
ethical
violation
with
severe
emotional
consequences
.

However
,
occasional
sexual
feelings
are
not
in
themselves
either
unethical
or
even
particularly
abnormal
in
the
context
of
an
intimate
therapeutic
relationship
(
Pope	B	Pope	Pope	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope	000	000
and
Vasquez
,
1998
)
.

Counselors
must
acknowledge
and
appropriately
process
the
existence
of
these
feelings
when
they
emerge
in
order
to
successfully
understand
and
redirect
them
.

The
presence
of
intense
preoccupation
or
sexual
fantasies
involving
clients
needs
to
be
forthrightly
discussed
in
consultation
and
supervision
.

Recovery
Boundaries
.

Counselors
who
have
successfully
dealt
with
addictive
disorders
in
their
own
lives
can
often
relate
to
their
clients
with
profound
understanding
,
empathy
,
and
clarity
.

However
,
they
may
also
be
overly
devoted
to
the
treatment
approach
they
personally
found
successful
(
Johnson	B	Johnson	Glen_Johnson_(English_footballer)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Johnson_(English_footballer)	000	000
,
2000
)
.

For
instance
,
counselors
who
are
strongly
12-step
oriented
may
discount
non-abstinence
models
for
addressing
substance
abuse
,
such
as
risk
reduction
strategies
,
which
threatens
to
place
clients
into
a
one-size-fits-all
philosophy
of
care
.

A
counselor
who
is
candid
about
being
"
in
recovery
"
may
give
clients
hope
and
reduce
the
shame
that
inevitably
accompanies
addiction
.

However
,
too
much
disclosure
can
be
intrusive
and
distracting
for
some
clients
,
and
can
even
inadvertently
generate
unrealistic
expectations
or
a
sense
of
inadequacy
(
Bloomgarden
,
2000
)
.

Counselors
should
therefore
carefully
reveal
information
about
their
personal
addiction
experience
only
in
as
much
detail
as
is
necessary
to
meet
a
compelling
and
clearly
defined
clinical
need
.

A
counselor
who
is
treating
clients
with
substance
use
disorders
should
not
be
unsuccessfully
fighting
the
same
battle
.

Sustained
abstinence
from
addictive
behavior
is
an
inescapable
ethical
responsibility
for
anybody
working
in
this
field
.

Counselors
with
less
than
several
years
of
recovery
time
may
easily
lose
objectivity
when
dealing
with
clients
whose
clinical
picture
mirrors
their
own
personal
experience
.

Heightened
levels
of
consultation
and
supervision
are
highly
advisable
in
such
circumstances
.

Nobody
is
immune
to
relapse
,
regardless
of
the
length
of
time
in
recovery
.

A
counselor
who
reverts
to
a
previous
pattern
of
addictive
behavior
must
face
the
ethical
dilemma
of
whether
to
limit
,
suspend
,
or
terminate
clinical
duties
.

Abruptly
withdrawing
services
from
a
client
due
to
this
(
or
any
other
)
form
of
counselor
impairment
is
likely
to
be
deeply
disruptive
to
the
client
's
healing
process
(
Bissell
and
Royce
,
1994
)
.

Clients
in
such
situations
must
be
given
the
opportunity
to
continue
counseling
with
another
provider
.

There
is
no
one
answer
to
the
problem
of
counselor
relapse
that
is
completely
satisfying
.

In
this
regard
the
difference
between
a
temporary
"
slip
"
that
can
result
in
increased
self-awareness
and
an
unrestrained
relapse
may
be
useful
in
determining
a
counselor
's
overall
level
of
clinical
impairment
.

These
decisions
should
be
made
in
a
process
of
supervision
and
consultation
so
that
the
counselor
is
not
relying
on
his
or
her
personal
judgment
,
which
may
be
impaired
.

All
counselors
who
are
in
recovery
from
addictive
behavior
must
establish
whatever
safeguards
are
necessary
to
ensure
the
maintenance
of
a
personal
program
of
sobriety
.

This
may
include
establishing
boundaries
around
support
group
meetings
that
clients
are
asked
not
to
attend
.

It
is
not
ethically
appropriate
for
counselors
in
12-step
recovery
to
sponsor
their
own
patients
or
chair
meetings
where
they
are
employed
(
Bissell
and
Royce
,
1994
)
.

Supervision

The
next
core
ethical
concept
is
for
counselors
to
have
a
structured
process
for
discussing
formulations
,
interventions
,
reactions
,
and
inevitable
difficulties
with
supervisors
and
colleagues
.

There
is
a
heightened
need
for
supervision
and
consultation
for
counselors
who
are
working
on
the
outer
limits
of
either
personal
competence
or
established
theory
(
Corey
et
al.
,
1998
)
.

For
example
,
a
counselor
attempting
to
implement
a
new
technique
should
utilize
close
supervision
until
it
becomes
fully
integrated
into
his
or
her
set
of
skills
.

It
's
an
unfortunate
reality
that
not
all
clinical
supervisors
have
adequate
experience
or
knowledge
in
the
treatment
of
addictive
disorders
.

In
such
cases
a
counselor
needs
to
seek
out
additional
sources
for
case
consultation
.

One
solution
is
to
set
up
and
utilize
informal
telephone
and
e-mail
networks
which
can
be
established
fairly
easily
with
colleagues
and
contacts
made
through
professional
affiliations
.

When
consultation
is
not
available
for
discussing
a
clinical
or
ethical
dilemma
,
a
counselor
should
document
in
the
clinical
record
a
summary
of
the
relevant
issues
as
well
as
any
action
taken
in
response
to
it
.

Honoring
diverse
values

All
of
the
preceding
ethical
principles
involve
some
specific
actions
for
a
counselor
to
take
.

However
,
the
ethical
dimension
of
counseling
goes
far
beyond
merely
abiding
by
a
procedural
checklist
.

An
ethical
counselor
consistently
demonstrates
respect
for
the
client
as
a
person
by
honoring
diversity
and
appreciating
the
degree
to
which
his
or
her
personal
values
influence
the
entire
process
of
counseling
.

Since
counselors
are
in
the
business
of
helping
clients
change
some
aspect
of
their
lives
,
the
great
ethical
challenge
is
to
effectively
guide
the
process
and
direction
of
this
change
without
undermining
the
client
's
autonomy
.

This
ethical
use
of
a
counselor
's
influence
is
a
skill
that
can
not
be
taught
as
much
as
developed
.

Since
every
person
's
view
of
the
world
represents
a
unique
combination
of
diverse
personal
and
cultural
perspectives
,
it
is
inevitable
that
counselors
will
sometimes
hold
views
that
are
very
different
from
their
clients
.

No
counselor
is
ethically
justified
in
assuming
that
the
way
he
or
she
views
life
is
the
way
everybody
else
does
,
is
the
right
way
,
or
is
the
only
way
.

However
,
some
counselors
act
as
if
the
way
to
avoid
imposing
their
personal
values
is
to
simply
not
talk
about
them
.

But
biases
do
n't
lose
their
influence
just
because
they
're
not
discussed
;
in
fact
they
often
become
less
amenable
to
change
.

It
is
often
more
ethically
beneficial
for
a
counselor
to
invite
discussion
about
his
or
her
personal
values
while
conveying
an
ability
to
respect
and
work
with
many
alternative
positions
.

A
counselor
does
n't
need
to
be
neutral
about
his
or
her
values
in
order
to
be
nonjudgmental
(
Coale
,
1998
;
Tjeltveit
,
1999
)
.

When
a
client
and
a
counselor
hold
fundamentally
incompatible
value
orientations
,
the
counselor
should
either
refer
the
case
or
strive
to
help
the
client
achieve
the
goals
of
counseling
within
the
context
of
the
client
's
value
system
rather
than
attempting
to
change
those
values
.

If
a
counselor
finds
it
necessary
to
attempt
to
modify
a
client
's
values
,
this
should
be
done
to
no
more
extent
than
is
necessary
to
address
that
client
's
particular
focus
of
treatment
.

Counselors
often
avoid
initiating
discussion
with
clients
about
the
ethical
dimensions
of
clinical
issues
.

Sometimes
this
reluctance
stems
from
the
fear
of
appearing
moralistic
,
but
it
also
reflects
a
general
tendency
of
the
counseling
profession
to
be
ethically
inarticulate
.

It
takes
considerable
effort
and
skill
to
engage
in
thoughtful
dialogue
about
the
ethical
aspects
of
life
,
but
doing
so
can
have
great
benefit
for
clients
whose
history
of
addiction
is
marked
by
diminished
personal
integrity
.

While
this
does
not
guarantee
a
positive
clinical
outcome
,
it
does
foster
the
kind
of
therapeutic
environment
for
a
client
to
utilize
the
counseling
experience
to
its
fullest
potential
.

These
guidelines
are
not
an
exhaustive
review
of
every
ethical
issue
related
to
addictions
counseling
and
they
can
not
substitute
for
a
counselor
's
knowledge
of
his
or
her
professional
code
of
conduct
.

Many
clinical
situations
require
a
more
detailed
examination
of
the
ethical
issues
involved
or
compliance
with
specific
codified
procedures
,
such
as
guidelines
for
research
involving
human
subjects
.

Although
counselors
almost
always
operate
within
ethical
parameters
,
these
principles
can
serve
as
a
helpful
reminder
of
some
of
the
important
points
to
consider
when
evaluating
the
proper
ethical
stance
to
take
when
dealing
with
the
many
complexities
of
addictions
counseling
.

employed
as
a
juvenile
addictions
counselor
this
article
reiterates
to
me
thatEthical
guidelines
for
Addiction
Counselors
must
be
excuted
in
order
to
maximizethe
success
of
all
clients
.

Developing
a
counselor
client
relationship
withjuveniles
can
be
challenging
and
rewarding
.

However
the
one
delima
thatsurpasses
all
others
working
with
juvenile
is
confidentiality
.

Even
though
theysign
consent
forms
for
releaselof
certain
information
it
is
very
important
to
besure
they
understand
what
information
they
are
consenting
or
authorizing
to
bereleased
.

Their
misunderstanding
can
damage
the
counselor
client
relationship

in
an

taking

I
thought
it
was
very
important
what
this
article
mentioned
.

That
is
,
that

nomatter
how
much
time
the
client
have
been
sober
he
or
she
can
alwaysrelapse
.

Also
,
especially
when
we
deal
with
addictions
because
of
the
stigmais
always
important
to
keep
confidentiality
.

And
of
course
,
before
I
startworking
with
the
client
,
the
client
must
sign
a
consent
.

Also
remember
counselors
can
also
relapse
.

When
this
happens
that
counselorwill
need
to
work
on
their
own
soberity
.

In
doing
so
that
caseload-clients
maynot
receive
the
support
they
need
from
that
counselor
and
shouls
thatinformation
be
disclosed
to
a
supervisor
or
kept
confidential
,

I
'm
glad
that
the
ethical
guidelines
have
focus
on
tough
.

While
attending
AA/NAmeetings
,
I
always
though
that
the
"
hug
"
thing
was
sometimes
toopersonal
.

I
'm
glad
that
there
are
"
rules
"
because
some
people
areoffended
and
to
gain
good
rapport
from
the
very
geginning
I
feel
that
"
space
"
shows
respect
for
both
consumer
and
counselor
.

In
addition
,
theduty
to
warn/protect
is
a
very
tricky
guideline
in
any
situation
.

As
a
goodcounselor
you
just
have
to
face
the
fact
that
this
guideline
will
benefiteveryone
involved
.

For
example
,
if
a
client
has
revealed
to
you
that
he/sheuses
hyperdemic
needle
that
belong
to
a
family
member
who
has
diabetes
,
to
stopa
possible
infection
of
diseases
,
this
should
be
reported
to
authorities
.

Ifound

informative

It
answered
many
questions
that
I
hadconcerning

In

,
the

I

Excellent
information
.

I
'm
in
my
Master
's
in
Psychology

All
of
theabove
information
I
have

Confidentiality
is
extremelyimportant
and
the
codes
of
ethics
is
a
must
.

I
found
the
article
to
be
very
informative
and
needful
.

I
was
very
surprised
tolearn
that
if
a
couple
is
in
marital
counseling
that
they
have
to
sign
aninformed
consent
in
order
to
share
what
was
shared
in
their
individual
session
.

I
was
impressed
about
the
way
confidentially
is
secured
by
state
and
federallaws
.

I
was
surprised
to
learn
that
when
a
counselor
is
counseling
to
a
marriedcouple
,
that
if
one
is
having
a
one
on
one
with
the
counselor
he
must
haveinformed
consent
to
reveal
what
was
discussed
in
the
session
with
the
otherfamily
member
.

I
was
slso
surprised
to
see
that
a
counselor
can
disclosure
hispersonal
information
with
the
client
as
long
as
it
is
well
after
it
has
beenresolved
.

I
was
also
surprised
to
learn
that
if
a
counselor
has
sexual
feelingsthat
might
jeopardize
the
counseling
with
the
client
that
he
has
to
go
intoconsultation
with
a
supervisor
and
reveal
this
.

Fixing
America
's
Health
Care
Crisis

By
XAVIER
MARTINEZ

Washington
,
D.C.

Most
experts
agree
that
the
United	B	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
States	I	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
has
set
the
standard
for
health

care
innovation
.

Thousands
of
people
from
around
the
world
travel
to
the

US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
each
year
for
medical
treatment
not
found
anywhere
else
.

But
many
analysts

say
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
's
health
care
policy
needs
drastic
reform
.

Will
patients
,
doctors
,
insurance
companies
and
the
government
see
eye-to-eye

on
health
care
reform
?

The
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
government
offers
free
health
insurance
coverage
to
some
27
percent

of
the
population
.

For
the
elderly
and
many
disabled
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
,
the
federal

Medicare	B	Medicare	Medicare_(United_States)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)	000	000
program
covers
about
80
percent
of
medical
costs
.

Medicaid
programs

help
insure
the
nations
poor
.

about

low

children
whose
families
are
ineligible

for
Medicaid	B	Medicaid	Medicaid	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid	000	000
but
can
not
afford
private
health
insurance
.

The
rest
of
the

population
must
find
health
care
coverage
on
their
own
,
typically
through

employers
.

But
many
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
have
to
bear
the
full
cost
of
health
insurance
.

For
an

average
family
,
that
ranges
from
11
thousand
to
12
thousand
dollars
a
year
.

And
even
that
does
not
cover
the
full
cost
of
medical
care
.

Millions
of
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000

often
have
trouble
paying
for
prescription
drugs
and
other
treatments
.
"

Here
is
a
country
with
a
very
expensive
and
very
vast
health
care

system
that
leaves
many
out
of
being
able
to
participate
fully
in
the
abundance

of
the
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
health
care
system
,

"

We
need
an

to
reinvest
in

people
and
reinvest
in

are
Uninsured

There

are
a
lot
of
different
reasons
why
people
are
uninsured
--
some
of
which

have
to
do
with
what
they
perceive
to
be
the
affordability
,
some
of
which

have
to
do
with
their
access
to
different
kinds
of
health
plans
,
and
some

of
it
has
to
do
with
their
individual
preferences
as
to
how
they
view
health

insurance
and
medical
care
.
"

Cohen
says
many
people
between
the
ages
of
19
and
29

believe
they
are
healthy
and
do
not
need
costly
medical
insurance
.

Overall
,

he
says
,
insurance
coverage
varies
with
the
fluctuating
economy
.
"

Most

people
get
their
insurance
through
their
employment
.

So
as
unemployment

increases
,
then
people
would
have
more
difficulty
getting
insurance
.

On

the
other
hand
,
if
the
economy
improves
and
more
people
are
employed
,
then

it
would
go
down
.

So
there
is
a
little
bit
of
an
economic
cycle
to
that
.
"

Radical
Reform

About
60
percent
of
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
receive
health
insurance
through
their
workplace
.

Employers
typically
offer
workers
insurance
plans
that
cover
a
portion
of

health
care
costs
,
leaving
employees
responsible
for
the
difference
.

With

nearly
16
percent
of
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
uninsured
,
some
analysts
say
federally-funded

health
care
coverage
for
all
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
is
the
answer
.
"

We
are
the
only
industrialized
country
without
universal
health
insurance

coverage
,
"
says
Sara
Collins
,
Assistant
Vice
President
for
the
Commonwealth	B	Commonwealth Fund	Commonwealth_Fund	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund	000	000
Fund	I	Commonwealth Fund	Commonwealth_Fund	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Fund	000	000
,
a
private
foundation
that
provides
support
for
health
care
research
.
"

You

notice
when
you
look
at
our
rate
of
cost
growth
compared
to
France	B	France	France	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France	000	000
,
compared

to
Germany	B	Germany	Germany	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany	000	000
,
compared
to
Canada	B	Canada	Canada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada	000	000
,
we
have
a
much
higher
rate
of
cost
growth
.

We
spend
a
much
larger
percentage
of
our
GDP	B	GDP	Gross_domestic_product	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product	000	000
[
i.e.
,
gross
domestic
product
]

on
health
care
costs
than
do
other
countries
where
everybody
is
in
the
same

system
.

And
we
actually
have
much
poorer
health
outcomes
;
we
rank
among
the

very
bottom
in
infant
mortality
compared
to
our
neighbors
overseas
[
in
developed

countries
]
.

I
think
that
the
health
system
would
improve
dramatically
by

including
everybody
in
the
system
as
other
industrialized
countries
are
doing

now
.
"

Many
people
equate
universal
health
insurance
with
socialized
medicine
.

But
analysts
say
socialized
medicine
is
government
control
over
all
aspects

of
health
care
,
while
the
government
would
administer
only
insurance
programs

under
a
universal
health
insurance
system
.

Critics
of
universal
coverage

point
out
that
patients
in
Canada	B	Canada	Canada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada	000	000
and
Britain	B	Britain	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
,
for
example
,
often
encounter

long
waits
for
medical
care
and
have
little
choice
in
selecting
doctors
.

Fixing
the
Current
System

Scott
Serota
is
President
and
CEO
of
the
BlueCross
BlueShield
Association
,

the
largest
group
of
private
health
insurance
franchises
in
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
He
admits

the
current
system
needs
reform
,
but
he
says
he
is
wary
of
a
system
that

might
not
sustain
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
's
standard
of
health
care
.
"

My
biggest
comment
to
the
critics
of
the
current
financing
system

is
it
has
created
a
health
care
system
second
to
none
in
the
world
.

And
we

need
to
ensure
we
continue
to
support
that
system
while
modifying
the
incentives

in
such
a
fashion
that
we
can
continue
to
afford
that
system
,
"
says

Serota
.
"

I
think
we
need
to
move
away
from
a
finger
pointing
exercise

and
toward
a
solution-oriented
exercise
,
which
says
these
are
the
problems

and
this
is
how
we
need
to
fix
them
.
"

According
to
Serota
,
the
insurance
industry
supports
reforms
that
focus

on
disease
prevention
,
chronic
illness
management
and
health
information

technology
.

But
,
he
says
,
the
industry
does
not
support
reforms
that
would

increase
government
bureaucracy
in
order
to
manage
the
nation
's
health
care

industry
.

Several
public
opinion
polls
show
that
rising
health
care
costs

are
the
number
one
domestic
concern
among
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
voters
ahead
of
next
year
's

national
elections

We
all
see
that
laptops
and
notebooks
are
helpful
tools
that
provide
for
work
,
studies
and
fun
purposes
.

Now
we
have
the
latest
trend
in
the
market
which
is
the
mini-notebook
.

It
is
more
widely
known
as
netbook
.

It
is
small
with
only
13
inches
measurement
for
its
screen
.

Various
major
computer
companies
are
having
these
cool
devices
on
sale
.

If
you
are
planning
to
get
one
,
it
is
better
to
properly
understand
its
functions
in
order
to
know
that
this
is
what
exactly
will
meet
your
needs
.

Here
will
help
you
to
make
up
your
mind
whether
to
purchase
one
or
not
.

First
of
all
,
let
us
see
the
good
sides
of
the
mini-notebook
functions
.

It
is
smaller
and
lighter
in
comparison
to
other
general
laptops
or
notebooks
.

It
is
like
a
standard
normal
book
which
could
be
easily
carried
with
the
hand
.

Since
it
is
so
portable
,
an
individual
could
bring
it
to
wherever
he
or
she
wants
to
travel
to
.

It
could
be
light
in
the
bag
and
there
more
spaces
in
the
bag
where
other
things
could
also
be
stuffed
in
.

Ladies
will
especially
appreciate
this
as
she
may
have
keys
,
make-up
things
,
tissues
,
mobile
phone
and
water
bottle
to
carry
together
.

With
conventional
notebook
,
one
may
have
to
carry
a
separate
bag
just
for
the
device
.

Another
advantage
is
that
it
does
function
fully
as
any
computer
.

It
has
all
the
main
operating
system
and
applications
,
ports
for
connections
,
Wi-Fi	B	Wi-Fi	Wi-Fi	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi	000	000
,
webcam
,
CD-ROM	B	CD-ROM	CD-ROM	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM	000	000
or
burner
and
functional
keyboard
.

Apart
from
that
,
the
price
and
cost
is
low
and
affordable
.

Thenetbook
would
not
cost
much
higher
than
any
ordinary
laptop
or
notebook
and
it
is
inexpensive
for
anyone
to
purchase
.

Overall
,
this
small
device
is
for
those
who
are
always
on
the
go
for
businesses
in
usages
of
e-mail
and
quick
note-taking
.

It
is
also
for
students
to
carry
for
typing
lecture
notes
rather
than
writing
down
.

Here
comes
the
downside
of
this
small
computer
.

Although
it
is
fully
functional
,
it
has
limitations
.

The
processor
plus
the
memory
are
lower
in
speed
and
it
causes
a
file
to
be
played
slower
.

For
example
,
a
video
may
pause
by
itself
and
then
continues
playing
.

It
may
repeat
the
same
over
and
over
again
.

While
downloading
files
,
there
may
be
complications
too
.

The
smaller
screen
and
keyboard
may
pose
a
problem
depending
on
different
users
.

If
you
are
planning
to
do
major
work
with
long
hours
,
it
is
advise
not
to
buy
this
type
of
computer
as
the
battery
life
will
not
support
longer
hours
like
conventional
laptop
does
.

In
the
end
it
is
up
to
you
whether
to
own
a
mini-notebook
depending
on
what
your
usages
are
.

's
known
as

Now

people

.

This
has
trapped
a
value
of
every
mobile
and
technology
fan
in
recent
times
and
mobile

demand
in
the
market
have
grown
very
hastily.Mobile

Important
Factors
for
a
Successful
Enterprise
Mobility
Strategy
The
need
was
not
felt
until
the
world
realized
the
power
of
mobility
.

Mobile
Applications
were
limited
as
data
exchange
was
uncommon
,
and
the
devices
themselves
functioned
in
isolation
from
one
another
.

Enterprises
were
unaware
of
the
benefits
that
could
be
reaped
from
mobility
.

With
advancement
of
mobile
technologies
most
enterprises
have
started
understanding
that
mobility
can
bring
enormous
advantages
yet
many
enterprises
are
not
sure
how
best
to
optimize
and
customize
these
benefits
.

A
right
way
to
go
about
this
for
an
Enterprise	B	Enterprise	Enterprise_software	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software	000	000
is
to
build
a
good
mobility
strategy.New

Backup
and
Security
Application
The
data
occupying
the
smartphone
memories
are
very
large
and
highly
personal
.

The
possible
loss
of
data
can
happen
not
only
due
to
a
theft
of
the
phone
but
also
due
to
other
mishaps
like
a
clumsy
moment
that
might
destroy
the
phone
as
a
whole
!

It
is
in
such
unexpected
moments
the
users
hope
for
having
a
backup
of
their
important

Is
the
Recession
U
shaped
?

On
a
day
when
the
unemployment
rate
spikes
by
half
a
percentage
point
,
we
may
be
past
questioning
whether
a
recession
in
the
U.S.
is
here
.

A
month
ago
,
Noriel
Roubini
framed
the
question
smartly
:
In
principle
,
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
recession
could
end
up
being
shaped
like
a
V	B	V	Carl_Linnaeus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus	000	000
,
U
,
W	B	W	Watt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt	000	000
,
or
L.	B	L.	Carl_Linnaeus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus	000	000
Which
of
these
four
scenarios
is
most
likely
?

The
current
consensus
is
that
the
recession
will
be
V	B	V	Carl_Linnaeus	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus	000	000
-
shaped
--
short
and
shallow
--
and
thus
similar
to
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
recessions
in
1990-91
and
2001
,
which
lasted
eight
months
each
.

Most
analysts
forecast
that
GDP
will
contract
in
the
first
half
of
2008
and
recover
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
.

I
expect
a
longer
and
deeper
U-shaped
recession
,
lasting
at
least
12
months
and
possibly
as
long
as
18
months
--
one
of
the
most
severe
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
recessions
in
decades
--
because
today
’s
macroeconomic
and
financial
conditions
are
far
worse
.

Now
on
the
spectrum
of
macroeconomic
analysis
,
growth
sits
on
the
long-term
end
of
the
spectrum
,
whereas
recession-watching
is
on
the
short-term
end
.

This
is
my
way
of
saying
,
growthology.org
really
should
n’t
be
commenting
on
the
recession
stuff
...
too
small
ball
.

So
here
’s
my
justification
:

I
’ve
published
on
this
topic
recently
.

My
little
model
-
the
employment
recession
indicator
--
says
the
recession
probability
is
in
the
50
%
range
.

It
will
go
higher
(
and
I
’ll
believe
the
recession
has
spread
from
financial
markets
to
the
real
economy
)
once
initial
jobless
claims
rise
above
400,000
consistently
and
unemployment
goes
to
6.0
%
.

That
may
happen
soon
,
and
when
it
does
,
count
me
among
the
bears
.

But
UI	B	UI	User_interface	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface	000	000
claims
remain
too
low
for
a
recession
,
and
they
tend
to
be
early
warning
signals
.

The
specter
of
the
Great	B	Great Depression	Great_Depression	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression	000	000
Depression	I	Great Depression	Great_Depression	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression	000	000
haunts
any
public
conversation
about
economics
,
which
includes
this
blog
.

And
lest
we
forget
,
momentous
shifts
in
popular
and
professional
thinking
occurred
during
the
1930s
.

In
particular
,
the
breakthrough
work
of
our
patron
saint
(
Joseph	B	Joseph Schumpeter	Joseph_Schumpeter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter	000	000
Schumpeter	I	Joseph Schumpeter	Joseph_Schumpeter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter	000	000
)
was
notoriously
overshadowed
by
the
breakthrough
work
of
JM	B	JM Keynes	John_Maynard_Keynes	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes	000	000
Keynes	I	JM Keynes	John_Maynard_Keynes	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes	000	000
.

I
dislike
historical
parallels
such
as
“
This
recession
has
signs
of
becoming
another
great
depression
”
because
(
here
’s
a
Kane	B	Kane	Kane_(wrestler)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_(wrestler)	000	000
mantra
)
Growth
Trumps
All
Historical
Parallels
.

No
,
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
is
not
analogous
to
a
new
Roman	B	Roman Empire	Roman_Empire	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire	000	000
Empire	I	Roman Empire	Roman_Empire	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire	000	000
.

No
,
the
housing
meltdown
is
not
akin
to
1929
’s
great
crash
.

Technological
dynamism
makes
modernity
so
different
from
previous
eras
that
no
parallel
really
works
.

To
clarify
the
larger
posturing
,
ask
yourself
this
:
what
is
more
important
to
contemporary
affairs
:
hegemony
,
terrorism
,
or
technology
?

Answer
:
technology
.

What
’s
a
bigger
deal
in
the
sweep
of
history
:
asset
bubbles
or
technology
?

Answer
:
technology
.

Point
being
,
I
doubt
the
upcoming
political
debate
of
2008
-
which
will
focus
on
short-term
economics
and
the
War	B	War on Terror	War_on_Terror	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror	000	000
on	I	War on Terror	War_on_Terror	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror	000	000
Terror	I	War on Terror	War_on_Terror	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Terror	000	000
-
will
address
the
most
important
issue
of
technology
acceleration
and
its
implications
.

Remember
when
the
NASDAQ	B	NASDAQ	NASDAQ	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ	000	000
crashed
and
the
media
said
,
“
The
New
Economy
Was
an
Illusion
.
”

They
were
wrong
.

The
Internet
’s
still
here
,
folks
,
bigger
than
ever
.

The
bottom
line
is
that
changes
wrought
by
technology
are
VERY
real
,
with
both
good
and
bad
consequences
.

It
is
the
topic
that
no
grand
strategist
,
or
politician
,
or
pundit
should
be
allowed
to
ignore
.

Now
,
Roubini
might
agree
with
me
on
all
that
.

But
I
was
still
skeptical
about
the
recession
ever
being
called
,
until
this
morning
's
employment
report
.

My
best
guess
remains
that
it
wo
n’t
be
V
or
U
or
L
or
W
shaped
.

I
’m
looking
for
letters
on
my
keyboard
to
represent
my
prediction
.

Ah
,
here
it
is
:
0
(
as
in
null
set
)
I
think
aggressive
Fed	B	Fed	Federal_Reserve_System	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System	000	000
action
on
interest
rates
will
be
very
effective
in
the
short
term
(
albeit
inflationary
)
.

I
doubt
housing
assets
have
declined
enough
to
shake
the
lifecycle
consumption
smoothing
habits
of
Americans	B	Americans	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
,
meaning
GDP
and
the
real
economy
will
stagnate
but
not
recess
.

I
do
worry
about
oil
prices
,
but
anticipate/hope/pray
for
that
commodity
speculation
to
pop
.

And
ultimately
,
I
think
innovative
entrepreneurship
and
consequently
potential
GDP
are
accelerating
.

My
worst
case
scenario
has
a
deep
U-shaped
recession
that
masks
productivity
growth
for
a
year
or
two
,
followed
by
a
booming
catch-up
to
potential
GDP
in
2010-12
...
plus
lots
of
inflation
.

That
is
why
we
people
should
also
help
to
work
this
out
.

We
should
not
all
put
this
to
the
government
's
shoulder
.

We
made
up
the
community
,
we
can
do
more
if
we
are
together
.

Simple
things
.

Obeying
the
law
and
being
a
disciplined
individual
will
lessen
the
government
's
problem
.

The
lesser
the
government
's
other

,
the
more
they
can
concentrate
to
the
economic
problem
.

Depression	I	Great Depression	Great_Depression	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression	000	000
,
was
a
year
of
transition
for
Broadway	B	Broadway	Off-Broadway	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-Broadway	000	000
.

Not
too
many
musicals
were

And
the

of
them
are
not

or

.

In

there
was

”

And
,
to
an
extent
,
“
The
Bandwagon

”

That
show
is
never
revived
,
but
it
inspired
a

What
is

is
a

diuretic

prevents
your

levels
from
getting
too
low
.

is
used
to
diagnose
or
treat
a
condition
in
which
you
have
too
much
aldosterone
in
your
body
.

Aldosterone
is
a
hormone
produced
by
your
adrenal
glands
to
help
regulate
the
salt
and

balance
in
your
body
.

The
2019
Transportation
group
revisited
its
priorities
,
celebrated
progress
and
discussed
how
to
broaden
its
impact
when
it
met
this
week
.

Half
of
the
meeting
was
devoted
to
a
‘
visioning
’
exercise
where
the
group
responded
to
the
question
,
“
it
’s
Dec.
2019
and
the
media
asks
you
,
‘
what
has
this
group
accomplished
in
sustainable
transportation
in
the
last
ten
years
?

’”

Small
groups
brainstormed
and
then
the
larger
group
voted
for
their
favorites
among
the
long
list
of
‘
accomplishments
’
.

Top
vote
getters
are
:

We
adopted
‘
complete
streets
’
legislation
and
incorporate
it
in
every
road
project

We
’ve
completed
the
Towpath
Trail
and
the
Cleveland
neighborhood
connectors

We
have
predictable
transit
funding
from
the
federal
government

We
increased
‘
mode
shift
’
--
more
transit
riders
and
transportation
cyclists

“
The
next
meeting
we
’ll
talk
about
metrics
,
”
said
Mike
Neundorfer
,
president
of
Neundorfer
Particulate
Knowledge
and
co-convener
of
the
group
.

“
We
should
link
with
the
Metrics
group
that
came
out
of
the
2019
summit
.

And
among
us
we
should
divide
into
smaller
groups
and
work
on
developing
metrics
.
”

Projects
updates
followed
the
visioning
session
.

They
are
:

Improving
the
performance
of
Euclid
Corridor
as
a
Complete
Street

Kevin
Schmotzer
at
the
city
’s
Department
of
Economic
Development
,
offered
that
some
of
the
recent
changes
to
the
timing
of
traffic
lights
on
Euclid
Corridor
are
due
to
construction
.

“
Many
have
come
from
east-west
route
changes
and
from
RTA	B	RTA	Greater_Cleveland_Regional_Transit_Authority	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Cleveland_Regional_Transit_Authority	000	000
drivers
,
but
if
you
have
specific
intersections
of
concern
,
flag
them
.
”

Brad
Chase
at
GreenCityBlueLake
Institute
and
chair
of
RTA
Citizens
’
Advisory
Board
,
said
the
larger
concern
is
keeping
the
line
of
communication
open
between
the
city
,
RTA	B	RTA	Greater_Cleveland_Regional_Transit_Authority	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Cleveland_Regional_Transit_Authority	000	000
and
other
stakeholders
to
help
achieve
the
promised
20
minute
travel
time
from
Public	B	Public Square	Public_Square	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Square	000	000
Square	I	Public Square	Public_Square	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Square	000	000
to
East	B	East Cleveland	East_Cleveland,_Ohio	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Cleveland,_Ohio	000	000
Cleveland	I	East Cleveland	East_Cleveland,_Ohio	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Cleveland,_Ohio	000	000
.

“
How
do
we
have
better
communications
between
groups
in
corridor
,
and
how
do
we
define
a
Complete
Street
corridor
?
”

Chase
said
.

“
This
is
supposed
to
be
a
bus
,
pedestrian
and
bike
priority
corridor
.

If
we
want
to
get
this
(
complete
streets
)
working
around
the
city
,
we
have
to
get
it
right
here
first
.
”

John
Mitterholzer
,

Foundation	I	Gund Foundation	The_George_Gund_Foundation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_George_Gund_Foundation	000	000
and
a
2019
Transportation
group
co-convener
,
will
work
on
a
meeting
with
the
stakeholders
along
the
corridor
with
the
goal
of
establishing
a
“
better
communication
protocol
on
changes
”
that
have
lengthened
the
20
minute
trip
time
for
the
HealthLine	B	HealthLine	HealthLine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HealthLine	000	000
bus-rapid
transit
line
.

3-C
passenger
rail

Legislators
need
to
hear
the
urgency
from
supporters
of
the
3-C
,
said
Devan
Willemsen
,
Director
of
Air
&
Land
Use
Special
Projects
at
the
Ohio
Environmental
Council
.

Ohio
has
$
400
million
promised
from
the
federal
government
for
high
speed
rail
,
but
it
has
not
been
committed
by
the
state
.

“
It
’s
turning
into
a
bit
of
a
governor
’s
race
issue
.

Some
people
are
calling
multi-modalism
a
passing
fad
.

The
controlling
board
for
3-C
need
to
let
legislators
,
specifically
Bill	B	Bill Harris	Bill_Harris_(Ohio_politician)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Harris_(Ohio_politician)	000	000
Harris	I	Bill Harris	Bill_Harris_(Ohio_politician)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Harris_(Ohio_politician)	000	000
,
know
to
get
this
going
.
”

Mitterholzer
added
that
many
are
not
aware
that
the
federally
designated
high-speed
rail
corridors
will
continue
to
receive
funding
,
up
to
$
1
billion
over
next
few
years
.

“
If
we
turn
down
this
money
,
we
’re
done
with
rail
in
this
state
for
the
next
decade
.

We
’re
the
only
state
considering
turning
down
the
federal
money
.
”

of
the
3-C

Federal
funding
for
multi-modal
projects

Transportation
legislation
has
been
introduced
in
the
Senate	B	Senate	United_States_Senate	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate	000	000
,
after
the
House	B	House	House	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House	000	000
passed
its
version
.

said
RTC
Ohio
director
Rhonda
Border-Boose
.

“
Talk
about
predictable
,
federal
funding
--
this
is
it
,
”
she
said
.

Action
item
:
“
We
need
senate
support
--
specifically
Sen.
Voinovich
,
"
Border-Boose
said
.
'

We
would
like
a
‘
show
Congress	B	Congress	United_States_Congress	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress	000	000
’
event
,
to
tour
Voinovich
around
where
the
alternative
transportation
dollars
are
being
spent
.

Right
now
we
need
letters
to
legislators
.

Multi-purpose
path
on
the
Innerbelt
Bridge

Governor
Strickland	B	Strickland	Fauquier-Strickland	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauquier-Strickland	000	000
said
he
’d
like
ODOT	B	ODOT	Ohio_Department_of_Transportation	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Department_of_Transportation	000	000
to
look
again
at
the
feasibility
of
a
bike
and
pedestrian
path
on
the
new
Innerbelt	B	Innerbelt Bridge	Innerbelt_Bridge	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innerbelt_Bridge	000	000
Bridge	I	Innerbelt Bridge	Innerbelt_Bridge	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innerbelt_Bridge	000	000
.

“
He
has
a
couple
of
important
caveats
,
on
cost
and
safety
that
we
plan
to
address
,
”
said
ClevelandBikes
volunteer
Kevin
Cronin
.

“
We
deeply
appreciate
the
step
the
governor
took
,
and
Senator
Brown	B	Brown	Brown	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown	000	000
’s
letter
.

It
’s
a
testament
to
the
individuals
who
sent
letters
to
local
and
federal
leaders
.

We
’re
not
out
of
woods
yet
,
but
we
’re
making
progress
.
”

The
group
rounded
out
the
meeting
discussing
new
roles
to
sharpen
implementation
.

A
coordinator
that
works
with
the
city
,
a
liaison
to
other
2019
groups
,
a
strategic
plan
coordinator
,
and
an
executive
committee
for
the
group
were
some
of
the
positions
identified
for
further
discussion
.

In
its
wants
and
needs
category
,
the
group
identified
the
following
:

Can
we
convince
the
city
that
our
priorities
are
their
priorities
?

What
’s
our
role
from
2019
?

Identifying
right
minority
reps.

Sufficient
focus
.

Subcommittee
structure
.

ID	B	ID	Identity_document	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document	000	000
short

goals
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
group
.

Think
bigger
for
action
items
--
to
gain
traction
,
go
for
something
substantial
.

Keep
track
of
accomplishments
done
(
quantify
and
capture
)
.

.

Buy

from
local

.

Clearer

of

,
what
power
do
we
have
to
make
the
changes
?

Be

efficiency
and

readiness
.

The
Barracuda
Message
Archiver
is
an
integrated
hardware
and
software
solution
designed
to
archive
email

and
indexes
all
email
messages
in
real-time
while
making
them
immediately
available
for
rapid
searching
and
retrieval
by
authorized
users
.

To
immediately
capture
new
messages
,
the
Barracuda
Message
Archiver
can
take
advantage
of
the
journaling
feature
of
Microsoft	B	Microsoft Exchange	Microsoft_Exchange_Server	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Exchange_Server	000	000
Exchange	I	Microsoft Exchange	Microsoft_Exchange_Server	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Exchange_Server	000	000
and

searching
archives
and
creating
alerts
,
any
e-discovery
and
litigation
hold
requests
can
be
fulfilled
.

This
is
achieved
without
the
integration
hurdles
of
software-only
solutions
or
security
and
network
implications
when
using
hosted
services
.

With
the
sophisticated
roles-based
user
interface
and
tamper
resistant
storage
,
an
administrator
can
enforce
internal
access
control
to
help
comply
with

grandson
of
Carl
Faberge
,
the
jeweler
who
produced
ornate
Easter	B	Easter	Easter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter	000	000
gifts
for
the
Russian	B	Russian	Russia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia	000	000
tsars
.

Barks	B	Barks	Carl_Barks	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Barks	000	000
was
ninety-one
and
Faberge
was
seventy
and
,
for
the
first
time
,
they
combined
their
talents
to
create
a
modern
artwork
in
a
traditional
form
.

On
the
outside
,
the
creation
is
wholly
Theo
Faberge
's
.

He
has
imagined
the
façade
of
the
Treasury
Building
as
an
egg
,
its
dome
shining
austerely
under
the
night
sky
,
its
wings
wrapped
around
to
form
a
shell
.

Surmounting
the
dome
is
the
Imperial
Russian
Crown
that
can
be
seen
on
some
of
his
grandfather
's
greatest
creations
.

It
appears
as
well
on
nearly
every
egg
in
Theo
Faberge
's
acclaimed
St.Petersburg
Collection
.

Inside
,
the
fantasy
is
by
Barks	B	Barks	Carl_Barks	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Barks	000	000
:
Scrooge	B	Scrooge	Uncle_Scrooge	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Scrooge	000	000
at
play
in
the
Treasury	B	Treasury	United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury	000	000
,
but
executed
with
real
treasures
by
a
master
jeweler
.

The
fame
of
Faberge
dates
from
1870
,
when
Carl
Faberge
took
over
his
father
's
business
in
St.
Petersburg
.

Carl
was
a
shrewd
organizer
,
but
it
was
his
flair
for
creating
what
he
called

objects
de
fantaisie
that
put
the
family
name
on
the
map
.

Clocks
,
cuff
links
,
even
his
umbrella
handles
were
prized
for
their
beauty
and
delicate
use
of
enamels
.

Yet
these
rich
trinkets
pale
beside
the
series
of
jeweled
eggs
he
created
for
the
Romanov	B	Romanov	House_of_Romanov	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Romanov	000	000
tsars
.

Giving
eggs
at
Easter	B	Easter	Easter	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter	000	000
dates
back
to
the
Middle	B	Middle Ages	Middle_Ages	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages	000	000
Ages	I	Middle Ages	Middle_Ages	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages	000	000
.

The
gift
symbolizes
new
life
at
spring
and
new
hope
in
the
Resurrection	B	Resurrection	Resurrection	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection	000	000
.

Jeweled
eggs
-
often
with
candy
inside
-
were
a
favorite
with
the
aristocracy
,
and
Tsar	B	Tsar Alexander III	Alexander_III_of_Russia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Russia	000	000
Alexander	I	Tsar Alexander III	Alexander_III_of_Russia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Russia	000	000
III	I	Tsar Alexander III	Alexander_III_of_Russia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_III_of_Russia	000	000
wanted
a
very
special
present
for
his
Danish	B	Danish	Denmark	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark	000	000
tsarina
.

Carl
Faberge
created
a
white
enameled
egg
with
a
golden
yolk
-
and
inside
the
yolk
,
a
miniature
hen
of
gold
.

So
charmed
was
the
tsar
that
he
commissioned
an
egg
a
year
after
that
;
and
when
Nicholas	B	Nicholas II	Nicholas_II_of_Russia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia	000	000
II	I	Nicholas II	Nicholas_II_of_Russia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia	000	000
assumed
the
throne
,
he
continued
the
tradition
by
presenting
both
his
mother
and
his
wife
with
an
egg
,
each
containing
a
surprise
.

The
fall
of
the
Romanovs	B	Romanovs	House_of_Romanov	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Romanov	000	000
left
Faberge
's
son
Nicholas	B	Nicholas	Nicholas_II_of_Russia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia	000	000
stranded
in
London	B	London	London	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London	000	000
,
where
he
had
traveled
to
set
up
an
overseas
branch
.

His
own
son
,
Theo
,
founded
a
fresh
business
and
made
it
prosper
.

Today
he
is
a
member
of
Britain	B	Britain	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
's
Society
of
Ornamental
Turners
and
a
Freeman
of
the
City
of
London
.

And
he
continues
the
tradition
begun
with
the
Imperial	B	Imperial	Imperial_(automobile)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_(automobile)	000	000
eggs
by
issuing
new
creations
in
limited
editions
.

.

The
McDuck
Midnight
Egg
is
the
first
in
a
series
of
five
special
commissions
from
the
St.
Petersburg
Collection
that
will
feature
Uncle	B	Uncle Scrooge	Uncle_Scrooge	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Scrooge	000	000
Scrooge	I	Uncle Scrooge	Uncle_Scrooge	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Scrooge	000	000
.

The
shell
is
crystal
,
delicate
yet
durable
.

Its
dome
,
enameled
lapis
blue
to
suggest
the
midnight
sky
,
is
punctuated
by
seven
gold
stars
representing
the
decades
of
Theo
Faberge
's
life
.

Below
,
the
shell
has
been
etched
and
hand-painted
with
23-karat
gold
,
the
purest
gold
that
can
be
fired
onto
crystal
.

Architectural
forms
evoke
the
stateliness
of
the
Treasury
Building
and
its
egglike
,
contained
quality
.

A
flight
of
golden
stairs
leads
to
a
landing
flanked
by
ionic
columns
bearing
up
a
triangular
pediment
.

The
entrance
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
is
barred
by
a
golden
swag
rope
,
for
the
Treasury	B	Treasury	United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury	000	000
is
closed
.

But
between
the
columns
,
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
someone
inside
.

The
egg
separates
in
the
middle
.

Lift
off
the
top
,
and
there
's
Uncle	B	Uncle Scrooge	Uncle_Scrooge	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Scrooge	000	000
Scrooge	I	Uncle Scrooge	Uncle_Scrooge	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Scrooge	000	000
luxuriating
in
a
tub
of
gold
coins
.

His
body
is
silver
;
indeed
,
the
whole
sculpture
is
sterling
silver
-
92.5
percent
pure
.

To
show
this
,
the
rim
is
stamped
with
the
standard
mark
of
a
lion
pass
ant
.

It
also
bears
the
emblem
of
Theo
Faberge
(
TF	B	TF	Task_force	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_force	000	000
)
,
the
mark
of
the
assay
office
(
an
anchor
denoting
Birmingham	B	Birmingham	Birmingham	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham	000	000
)
,
and
a
letter
symbolizing
the
year
it
was
made
.

You
'll
need
a
magnifying
glass
to
see
that
,
and
to
appreciate
the
detailing
on
the
figure
.

Scrooge	B	Scrooge	Uncle_Scrooge	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Scrooge	000	000
's
coatis
enameled
in
red
;
his
collar
,
cuffs
,
and
spats
are
gray
.

His
crown
is
plated
in
24-karat
gold
,
as
are
his
beak
,
cane
,
tub
,
and
the
coins
around
him
;
different
colors
of
gold
give
each
a
different
luster
.

His
body
,
textured
to
resemble
feathers
,
is
lacquered
to
prevent
tarnish
,
while
the
urn
behind
him
has
intentionally
been
oxidized
to
a
rich
green
,
then
protected
with
lacquer
.

Surrounding

No

has
been
spared
to
make
this

a
treasure-house
in
miniature

And
in
the
tradition
of
the
nicest
Easter
eggs
,
there
's
a
second
surprise
,
a
treasure
within
the
treasure
.

Push
back

you
'll
find
an
extra

of
coins
,
ones
the
old

has
been
saving
for
a
rainy
day
.

The
Scrooge
McDuck
Midnight
Egg
is
made
in
London	B	London	London	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London	000	000
and
limited
worldwide
to
an
edition
of
250
individually
numbered
pieces
.

Each
is
etched
on
the
bottom
with
Theo
Faberge
's
signature
and
the
edition
number
.

'
signature
,
appropriately
,
is
engraved
on
the
base
of
the
silver
insert
.

In
addition
,
the
egg
comes
with
a
certificate
of
authenticity
signed
by
both
artists
.

Egg
and
certificate
are
housed
in
a
custom
carrying
case
,
made
especially
for
the
St.
Petersburg

.

Gold
fabric
and

Recently
the
great
Love

Egg
by
Carl
Faberge
sold
at
auction
for
$

The
farmers
who
brought
agriculture
to
central	B	central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
Europe	I	central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
about
7,500
years
ago
did
not
contribute
heavily
to
the
genetic
makeup
of
modern
Europeans	B	Europeans	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
,
according
to
the
first
detailed
analysis
of
ancient
DNA
extracted
from
skeletons
of
early
European	B	European	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
farmers
.

The
passionate
debate
over
the
origins
of
modern
Europeans	B	Europeans	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
has
a
long
history
,
and
this
work
strengthens
the
argument
that
people
of
central
European	B	European	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
ancestry
are
largely
the
descendants
of
"

hunter-gatherers
who
arrived
in
Europe	B	Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
around
40,000
years
ago
rather
than
the
first
farmers
who
arrived
tens
of
thousands
of
years
later
during
the
Neolithic	B	Neolithic Age	Neolithic	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic	000	000
Age	I	Neolithic Age	Neolithic	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic	000	000
.

This
paper
appears
in
the
11
November
2005
issue
of
the
journal
Science	B	Science	Science	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science	000	000

the
nonprofit
science
society
.

The
researchers
from
Germany	B	Germany	Germany	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany	000	000
,
the
United	B	United Kingdom	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
Kingdom	I	United Kingdom	United_Kingdom	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom	000	000
and
Estonia	B	Estonia	Estonia_national_football_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonia_national_football_team	000	000
extracted
and
analyzed
DNA
from
the
mitochondria
of
24
skeletons
of
early
farmers
from
16
locations
in
Germany	B	Germany	Germany	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany	000	000
,
Austria	B	Austria	Austria	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria	000	000
and
Hungary	B	Hungary	Hungary	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary	000	000
.

Six
of
these
24
skeletons
contain
genetic
signatures
that
are
extremely
rare
in
modern
European	B	European	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
populations
.

Based
on
this
discovery
,
the
researchers
conclude
that
early
farmers
did
not
leave
much
of
a
genetic
mark
on
modern
European	B	European	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
populations
.
"

This
was
a
surprise
.

I
expected
the
distribution
of
mitochondrial
DNA
in
these
early
farmers
to
be
more
similar
to
the
distribution
we
have
today
in
Europe	B	Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000

"

Our
paper
suggests
that
there
is
a
good
possibility
that
the
contribution
of
early
farmers
could
be
close
to
zero

To
get
at
questions
surrounding
the
ancestry
of
modern
Europeans	B	Europeans	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
,
the
researchers
studied
mitochondrial
DNA
from
early
farmers
in
Central	B	Central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
Europe	I	Central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
.

Mothers
pass
mitochondrial
DNA
to
their
offspring
primarily
"
as
is
,
"
without
mixing
or
recombination
with
mitochondrial
DNA
from
fathers
.

Mitochondrial
DNA
,
therefore
,
provides
a
way
for
researchers
to
piece
together
how
closely
members
of
a
species
are
related
,
using
maternal
lineages
as
a
guide
,
explained
Burger	B	Burger	Joachim_Burger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Burger	000	000
.

In
the
new
study
,
the
researchers
attempted
to
extract
mitochondrial
DNA
from
the
skeletons
of
56
humans
who
lived
in
various
parts
of
Central	B	Central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
Europe	I	Central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
about
7500
years
ago
.

These
ancient
humans
all
belonged
to
well
known
cultures
that
can
be
identified
by
the
decorations
on
their
pottery
--
the
Linearbandkeramik	B	Linearbandkeramik	Linear_Pottery_culture	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_Pottery_culture	000	000
(
LBK	B	LBK	Linear_Pottery_culture	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_Pottery_culture	000	000
)
and
the
Alföldi
Vonaldiszes
Kerámia
(
AVK
)
.

The
presence
of
these
cultures
in
Central	B	Central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
Europe	I	Central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
marks
the
onset
of
farming
in
the
region
.

These
farming
practices
originated
in
the
"
Fertile	B	Fertile Crescent	Fertile_Crescent	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_Crescent	000	000
Crescent	I	Fertile Crescent	Fertile_Crescent	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertile_Crescent	000	000
"
of
the
Near	B	Near East	Near_East	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East	000	000
East	I	Near East	Near_East	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_East	000	000
about
12,000
years
ago
.

From
bones
and
teeth
of
these
56
skeletons
,
the
researchers
extracted
mitochondrial
DNA
sufficient
for
analysis
from
24
of
the
skeletons
.

Six
of
the
24
early
farmers
belonged
to
the
"
N1a
"
human
lineage
,
according
to
genetic
signatures
or
"
haplotypes
"
in
their
mitochondrial
DNA
that
the
researchers
studied
.

These
six
skeletons
are
from
archeological
sites
all
across
central	B	central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
Europe	I	central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
.

Few
modern
Europeans	B	Europeans	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
belong
to
this
N1a
lineage
,
and
those
that
do
are
spread
across
much
of
Europe	B	Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
.

The
other
18
early
farmers
belonged
to
lineages
not
useful
for
investigating
the
genetic
origins
of
modern
Europeans	B	Europeans	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
because
their
genetic
signatures
from
the
scrutinized
region
of
mitochondrial
DNA
are
widespread
in
living
humans
,
according
to
the
authors
.

Using
the
tools
of
population
genetics
and
a
worldwide
database
of
35,000
modern
DNA
samples
,
the
researchers
investigated
the
genetic
legacy
of
early
European	B	European	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
farmers
based
on
the
fact
that
six
of
the
24
early
European	B	European	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
farmers
are
from
a
lineage
that
is
now
extremely
rare
in
Europe	B	Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
and
around
the
world
.

At
least
8
percent
of
the
early
farmers
belonged
to
the
N1a
lineage
,
according
to
the
researchers
who
estimate
the
range
was
between
8
and
42
percent
.

Even
this
conservative
estimate
of
8
percent
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
the
current
percentage
of
central
Europeans	B	Europeans	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
who
belong
to
the
N1a
lineage
--
0.2
percent
.

This
discrepancy
suggests
that
these
early
farmers
did
not
leave
much
of
a
genetic
mark
on
modern
Central
Europeans
,
the
authors
say
.
"

It
's
interesting
that
a
potentially
minor
migration
of
people
into
Central	B	Central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
Europe	I	Central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
had
such
a
huge
cultural
impact
,
"
said
Forster
.

Small
pioneer
groups
may
have
carried
farming
into
new
areas
of
Europe	B	Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
,
the
authors
suggest
.

Once
farming
had
taken
hold
,
the
surrounding
hunter-gatherers
could
have
adapted
the
new
culture
and
then
outnumbered
the
original
farmers
,
diluting
their
N1a
frequency
to
the
low
modern
level
.

A
range
of
archeological
research
supports
different
aspects
of
this
hypothesis
,
the
authors
say
.

Alternatively
,
a
different
population
may
have
replaced
the
early
farmers
in
Central	B	Central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
Europe	I	Central Europe	Central_Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe	000	000
,
eliminating
most
of
the
N1a
types
,
but
archaeological
evidence
for
this
scenario
is
scant
,
according
to
the
authors
.

Once
people
get
a
little
taste
of
fame
,
it
’s
hard
to
pass
up
.

Whether
it
’s
for
a
stellar
acting
career
or
scandalous
political
prostitution
affair
,
the
famous
(
or
infamous
)
get
used
to
the
attention
.

One
way
to
get
more
press
is
to
branch
off
into
other
areas
of
celebritydom
...
such
as
starting
a
music
career
.

However

Let
's
face
it
:
no
matter
how
great
a
video
game
series
is
,
there
's
usually
going
to
be
a
dark
stain

its

glistening

.

I
mean
,

Luckily
though
,
most
of
these

move
past
these
bad
projects
to
continue
producing
the
sorts

we
love

Logic
is
a
key
element
for
engineering
students
,
as
they
must
reason
through
problems
.

Besides
the
intrinsic
rewards
of
an
engineering
degree
,
students
may
pursue
it
for
the
lucrative
salaries
that
come
with
an
engineering
career
.

There
are
different
engineering
disciplines
and
all
of
the
top
five
engineering
schools
offer
programs
within
the
disciplines
.

These
disciplines
include
:

Architecture
-
designing
structures/buildings

Chemical
-
converting
raw
materials
to
usable
compounds

Civil
-
designing
infrastructure
like
roads
and
bridges

Computer
-
creating
all
aspects
of
computers

Electrical
-
manipulating
electricity
and
magnetism
to

Anemia	I	Fanconi Anemia	Fanconi_anemia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanconi_anemia	000	000
-
associated
cancers
are
generally
ineffective
.

Thus
,
there
is
a
need
for
development
of
effective
therapeutic
agents
for
these
cancers
with
minimal
toxicity
.

Our
studies
demonstrated
that
NM	B	NM	New_Mexico	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico	000	000
significantly
inhibited
the
growth
and
tumor
burden
of
FA

in

.

In
addition
,
invasive
parameters
,

as

MMP-2	B	MMP-2	MMP2	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMP2	000	000
and
-9
secretion
and
invasion
were
significantly
inhibited
by
NM	B	NM	New_Mexico	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico	000	000
in

These
findings
suggest
potential
of

Outsiders
in
Twenty20
Cup
North
Betting

There
is
a
large
group
of
counties
who
will
all
consider
themselves
outsiders
in
Twenty20
Cup
North
betting
.

Yorkshire	B	Yorkshire	Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club	000	000
,
Lancashire	B	Lancashire	Lancashire_County_Cricket_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_County_Cricket_Club	000	000
,
Leicestershire	B	Leicestershire	Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club	000	000
and
Warwickshire	B	Warwickshire	Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club	000	000
will
all
be
pushing
for
the
top
two
spots
.

Leicestershire	B	Leicestershire	Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club	000	000
are
probably
the
biggest
outsiders
in
Twenty20
Cup
North
betting
because
they
can
not
boast
as
good
a
squad
as
other
counties
in
the
section
.

However
,
they
have
experience
of
winning
this
tournament
before
and
will
want
that
feeling
of
success
back
.

Warwickshire	B	Warwickshire	Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club	000	000
could
attract
a
lot
of
attention
because
they
have
some
quality
England	B	England	England_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team	000	000
players
to
call
in
if
they
are
available
for
selection
.

Ian	B	Ian Bell	Ian_Bell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bell	000	000
Bell	I	Ian Bell	Ian_Bell	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bell	000	000
is
one
of
the
best
batsmen
in
the

and
he
will
be
playing
in
the
top
order
for
Warwickshire	B	Warwickshire	Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club	000	000
in

will
all
make
up
the
chasing

in
Twenty20

.

On
paper
,
not
one
of
these
sides
has
a
squad
strong
enough
to
contend
with
the
main
rivals
for
the
title
this
season.The
main
weakness
of
these
three
counties
is
inconsistency
and
this
has
held
them
back
in

a
roller

emotional

Snaps
to
the
makers
of
QAF
for
trying
to
bring
their
characters
into
the
grown-up
world
Michael
,
Emmett
,
and
Ted
started
their
own
businesses
;
Justin
finally
cut
loose
from
Brian
but
too
many
melodramatic
plot
twists
and
turns
impeded
a
lot
of
the
character
development
this
show
worked
hard
at
during
its
first
two
seasons
.

Still
,
most
of
the
cast
was
topnotch
,
including
Harrison
,
whose
Justin
finally
came
into
his
own
,
and
the
always
dependable
Harold
,
who
made
Brian
a
fascinating
creature
through
all
his
steamy
travails
and
over-the-top
encounters
.

most
amazing

of

,
and
a
few
other
surprises
.

I
have
seen
all
14
episodes
of
Season
3
and
it
is
another
great
season
with
some
major
twists
.

I
am
a
little
upset
that
this
season
is
very
short
when
compared
to
season
1
and
2
,
which
both
had
about
7
or
8
more
episodes
,
but
either
way
it
is
still
a
good
season
.

I
am
still
amazed
at
how
honest
this
show
is
on
dealing
with
gay
life
.

Not
every
gay
person
lives
a
life
like
these
guys
,
and
I
sure
do
n't
but
thatis
not
what
this
show
is
about
.

Queer
As
Folk
ia
about
the
life
of
a
group
of
gay
guys
and
a
lesbian
couple
living
in
Pittsburgh	B	Pittsburgh	Pittsburgh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh	000	000
.

Queer
As
Folk
makes
no
apologies
and
thats
what
is
so
great
about
this
series
.

From
the
graphic
sex
scenes
to
the
drama
of
dealing
with
the
prejudice
that
still
haunts
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
,
this
show
is
so
brave
and
I
give
Showtime	B	Showtime	Showtime_(TV_channel)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_channel)	000	000
a
big
thumbs
up
for
having
the
balls
to
take
on
such
a
big
risk
as

Folk	I	Queer As Folk	Queer_as_Folk_(2000_TV_series)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer_as_Folk_(2000_TV_series)	000	000
.

This
show
is
as
close
as
it
gets
to
real
life
.

This
is
not
a
show
just
for
gay
people
,
but
for
ALL
people
.

It
deals
with
human
emotion
and
thats
something
that
we
can
all
relate
to
whether
we
be
straight
,
gay
,
bisexual
,
black
,
white
,
brown
or
in
between
.

I
encourage
anyone
who
has
a
open
mind
and
a
open
heart
to
BUY
this
amazing
DVD	B	DVD	DVD	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD	000	000
collection
as
it
will
inspire
you
and
if
nothing
else
open
your
mind
to
a
lifestyle
not
as
uncommon
as
you
may
think
.

Watch
more
than
one
episode
before
you
judge
this
amazing
series
.

I
would
just
like
to
say
Queer
As
Folk
Season
1
and
2
are
also
great
to
own
.

I
will
be
in
line
when
they
release
Season
3

Markets
take
a
breather
after
recent
gains20/01/2012
(
10.30
am
)
After
seeing
strong
gains
this
week
,
stock
indices
are
showing
signs
today
of
some
exhaustion.It
is
possible
that
if
the
indices
close
in
negative
territory
today
this
could
set-up
a
minor
pullback
into
next
week
.

This
is
an
opportunity
to
potentially
capture
the
next
leg
to
the
upside
but
may
also
set
the
stage
for
a
decline
that
could
last
slightly
longer
.

What
is
important
is
that
coming
into
next
week
the
indices
do
not
decline
sharply
and
eradicate
the
recent
gains.The
FTSE	B	FTSE 100 Index	FTSE_100_Index	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index	000	000
100	I	FTSE 100 Index	FTSE_100_Index	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index	000	000
Index	I	FTSE 100 Index	FTSE_100_Index	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index	000	000
has
so
far
remained
above
5600
,
which
is
a
positive
sign
that
could
lift
the
index
higher
towards
the
5820
target
.

As
long
as
the
FTSE	B	FTSE	FTSE_100_Index	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index	000	000
maintains
a
hold
of
this
level
the
bulls
are
likely
to
remain
in
control
.

If
the
index
does
start
trading
below
5600
,
the
next
line
of
support
could
come
in
at
5585
--
5535
and
possibly
as
low
as
5487
.

These
areas
could
then
see
another
move
higher
to
clear
5820
and
ultimately
aim
for
the
6000
level.So
far
the
German	B	German	Germany	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany	000	000
Dax	B	Dax	DAX	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX	000	000
has
shown
strength
above
6200
and
is
also
clearing
past
6300
to
test
the
October
high
of
6430
.

As
long
as
we
see
the
index
remain
above
6300
,
the
resistance
level
of
6440
could
see
the
Dax	B	Dax	DAX	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX	000	000
struggle
and
pull
the
Dax	B	Dax	DAX	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX	000	000
down
towards
the
6300
area
.

Once
the
index
clears
past
6440
the
next
target
becomes
6720
.

This
could
prevent
the
index
moving
higher
before
seeing
a
significant
correction
.

For
now
though
the
focus
should
be
between
the
range
of
6300
--
6440
.

Heading
into
the
afternoon
session
,
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
Dow	B	Dow Jones	Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average	000	000
Jones	I	Dow Jones	Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average	000	000
should
see
mixed
trading
as
it
takes
its
cue
from
the
European	B	European	Europe	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe	000	000
markets
.

The
Dow	B	Dow	Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average	000	000
should
attempt
to
trade
above
12592
otherwise
the
index
may
see
a
drop
towards
12563
for
an
attempt
at
support
.

Below
this
level
the
index
could
struggle
into
the
close
to
catch
some
gains
.

If
the
mood
changes
from
negative
to
positive
the
index
may
seek
to
take
out
12625
level
and
reach
for
12670
today
.

Into
next
week
,
it
is
important
for
the
Dow	B	Dow	Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average	000	000
to
hold
onto
12450
to
ensure
that
positive
momentum
continues
over
the
weeks
to
come.Gold
prices
have
recouped
losses
at
the
start
of
this
week
and
managed
to
get
back
above
the
$
1600
level
.

Once
the
metal
clears
$
16880
we
could
see
gold
reach
for

Thursday

Thanks
for
another
great
lesson
.

I
wonder
if
there
is
a
difference
between
“
muftah
”
as
shown
in
the
vocab
list
and
“
miftah
”
.

I
only
know
the
latter
version
with
kasrah
for
“
keys
”
.

Mounia
says
:

That
’s
a
good
point
Anitagomez
.

The
difference
is
regional
.

The
word
for
“
key
”
in
Standard
Arabic
is
indeed
“
miftaaH
”
(
مِفْتاح
)
with
a
kasra
as
you
mentioned
.

However
,
in
some
countries
in
the
Middle	B	Middle East	Middle_East	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East	000	000
East	I	Middle East	Middle_East	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East	000	000
,
people
pronounce
it
“
muftaaH
”
when
they
speak
.

Kelly
says
:

Friday
at
1:17
am

I
’ve
noticed
that
in
the
female
“
you
”
form
,
sometimes
the
word
is
transcribed
with
an
“
a
”
sound
at
the
end
but
is
pronounced
without
it
,
or
vice
versa
.

For
example
,
in
today
’s
lesson
,
there
was
the
word
“
tadhhabiina
”
but
I
did
n’t
hear
the
“
a
”
sound
at
the
end
of
it
.

How
do
I
know
when
to
pronounce
the
“
a
”
sound
and
when
not
to
?

Thanks
!

Mounia
says

Hi
Kelly
,

That
’s
a
really
good
question
.

Sorry
for
the
late
reply
.

In
the
feminine
“
you
”
form
(
أنْتِ
)
,
verbs
end
with
a
fatHa
,
or
the
sound
“
a.
”
For
example
:
“
you
go
”
,
‘
anti
tadhhabiina
(
أنْتِ
تَذهَبينَ
)
,

or
“
you
do
”
,
‘
anti
turiidina
(
أنتِ
تُريدينَ
)
.

Usually
,
when
the
verbs
are
followed
by
another
word
,
then
we
pronounce
the
grammatical
ending
“
a.
”
Otherwise
,
it
’s
optional
and
some
native
speakers
choose
not
to
pronounce
the
“
a
”
sound
when
the
phrase
ends
with
the
verb
.

It
sounds
more
natural
.

For
example
:
‘
anti
tadhhabiina
‘
ilaa
al-madrasa
(
you
go
to
school
)
but
I
can
say

‘’
‘
ayna
tadhhabiin
?
”

(
where
do
you
go
?
)

Or
,
”
‘
anti
turiidiina
qahwa
”
(
you
want
coffee
)
.

But
I
can
say
,
“
madhaa
turiidiin
?
”

(
What
do
you
want
?
)

Note
that
in
all
cases
,
the
Haraka
“
a
”
is
present
but
we
tend
to
pronounce
it
more
when
verbs
are
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
.

Bhajji
’s
fans
will
be
very
delighted
to
see
him
playing
on
the
ground
again
.

Few
hours
before
,
Indian	B	Indian Cricket team	India_national_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team	000	000
Cricket	I	Indian Cricket team	India_national_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team	000	000
team	I	Indian Cricket team	India_national_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team	000	000
that
was
ready
to
come
back
leaving
the
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
tour
in
the
mid
,
is
all
set
to
play
for
20-20
match
in
Melbourne	B	Melbourne	Melbourne	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne	000	000
.

We
might
witness
a
healthy
tough
competition
between
the
two
leading
teams
of
the
world
.

Thank
God	B	God	God	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God	000	000
!

The
racism
charges
against
Harbhajan	B	Harbhajan Singh	Harbhajan_Singh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbhajan_Singh	000	000
Singh	I	Harbhajan Singh	Harbhajan_Singh	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbhajan_Singh	000	000
had
been
dropped
but
he
has
to
pay
50
per
cent
of
match
fees
.

Do
n’t
you
think
,
this
outcome
was
bound
to
happen
and
there
was
no
other
outcome
possible
?

Ultimately
,
money
rules
over
everything
else
.

There
is
too
much
money
at
stake
to
cancel
the
tour
both
officially
and
unofficially
A
lot
of
money
of
the
organizers
,
advertisers
and
sponsors
could
be
saved
due
the
decision
of
Indian	B	Indian	India	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India	000	000
team
to
play
the
one
day
series
too
.

We
all
know
cricket
is
not
only
game
but
also
a
nice
opportunity
for
corporate
houses
to
advertise
their
products
and
services.nnterDefinitely
,
few
people
like
me
would
not
like
to
accept
this
judgment
,
it
was
Symonds
who
provoked
Bhajji
first
then
he
should
be
the
first
one
who
should
be
punished
(
He
should
also
give
50
percent
of
his
match
fee
)
!

They
are
saying
Bhajji
is
let
off
for
his
past
good
behavior
,
as
if
they
are
doing
a
favour
to
him
and
India	B	India	India_national_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team	000	000
.

Also
the
Australian	B	Australian	Australia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia	000	000
team
has
proved
the
world
that
they
are
bunch
of
liars
and
cheats
supported
by
Procter.No
can
one
forget
that
India	B	India	India_national_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team	000	000
had
defeated
Australia	B	Australia	Australia_national_cricket_team	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team	000	000
in
20-20
match
finals
.

Yes
!

We
all
Indian	B	Indian	India	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India	000	000
cricket
enthusiastic
are
waiting
for
that
magic
again
.

Good
luck

Gilden
,

On
the
Heels
of
MS

Donald
H.
Gilden
,
’
63
,
knew
the
moment
he
touched
the
dying
man
’s
cold
hand
he
wanted
to
become
a
doctor
.

He
was
just
five
years
old
when
he
made
his
decision
.

His
grandfather
had
taken
him
to
visit
a
friend
who
was
dying
of
congestive
heart
failure
and
was
surviving
in
an
oxygen
tent
.

Young
Gilden
was
under
strict
orders
not
to
disturb
the
man
,
but
he
disobeyed
his
grandfather
slipping
his
hand
under
the
tent
.

The
old
man
squeezed
the
boy
’s
fingers
and
told
him
stories
about
his
grandfather
.

“
After
that
day
I
never
stopped
talking
about
it
,
”
says
Gilden
,
professor
and
chairman
of
the
department
of
neurology
and
professor
of
microbiology
at
the
University
of
Colorado
School
of
Medicine
.

“
I
was
going
to
be
a
doctor
when
I
grew
up
.

I
never
wanted
to
do
anything
else
.
”

Gilden
,
age
70
,
has
indeed
made
his
mark
on
the
profession
.

He
is
recognized
as
a
pioneer
in
the
field
of
neurovirology
for
groundbreaking
work
relating
to
shingles
and
multiple
sclerosis
(
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
)
.

After
nearly
150
years
of
medical
speculation
,
Gilden
discovered
that
varicella
zoster
virus
--
the
virus
that
causes
shingles
--
is
latent
in
human
ganglia
.

More
than
a
million
people
a
year
suffer
from
shingles
,
and
his
work
helped
lead
to
a
shingles
vaccination
.

He
has
also
been
working
to
track
down
the
virus
he
believes
causes
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
,
a
disease
that
affects
about
a
quarter
of
a
million
people
in
the
United	B	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
States	I	United States	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
.

But
this
has
been
far
more
challenging
.

Yet
Gilden
is
focused
on
what
he
wants
to
accomplish
and
understands
that
it
will
perhaps
take
the
rest
of
his
life
,
or
even
longer
,
to
reach
answers
.

“
You
have
to
be
patient
,
”
he
says
.

“
Science	B	Science	Science	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science	000	000
goes
little
by
little
.

Progress
is
little
by
little
.
”

For
his
work
,
Gilden
has
received
an
alumni
award
for
distinguished
service
from
the
University	B	University of Chicago School of Medicine	Pritzker_School_of_Medicine	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_School_of_Medicine	000	000

.

“
I
will
see
anyone
,
”
he
says
.

“
Clinical
neurology
has
always
been
one
of
my
first
loves
.
”

But
most
of
his
time
is
spent
in
the
lab
conducting
research
in
the
microscopic
world
of
DNA
,
RNA	B	RNA	RNA	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA	000	000
,
viruses
,
and
proteins
.

“
Sometimes
in
the
lab
my
head
is
spinning
because
we
have
big
things
going
on
,
”
Gilden
says
.

As
a
boy
growing
up
in
Baltimore	B	Baltimore	Baltimore	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore	000	000
,
Gilden
’s
world
revolved
around
school
and
working
summers
in
the
family
business
,
Sam
Gilden
&
Son
,
a
wholesale
store
that
supplied
hair
tonic
,
razor
blades
,
bobby
pins
,
toothpaste
,
and
other
items
to
local
drug
stores
.

He
unloaded
trucks
,
packed
orders
,
swept
floors
,
and
,
when
he
was
old
enough
,
made
deliveries
in
a
bright
red
Dodge	B	Dodge	Dodge	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge	000	000
delivery
truck
His
father
saw
him
taking
over
the
business
one
day
,
a
task
which
demanded
hard
work
and
long
hours
.

“
We
never
had
dinner
with
my
father
,
”
Gilden
recalls
.

“
The
wholesale
business
was
a
tough
business
.
”

Gilden
’s
real
“
job
”
was
to
go
to
school
,
and
he
excelled
in
biology
,
chemistry
,
and
math
.

Classes
in
foreign
language
,
however
,
barely
held
his
interest
.

“
For
me
the
language
of
medicine
was
all
I
ever
cared
about
,
”
he
says
.

He
graduated
from
Dartmouth	B	Dartmouth College	Dartmouth_College	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College	000	000
College	I	Dartmouth College	Dartmouth_College	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_College	000	000
in
1959
,
and
moved
back
home
to
go
to
medical
school
.

Gilden
interned
at
the
University
of
Illinois
Hospital
in
Chicago	B	Chicago	Chicago	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago	000	000
,
and
did
his
residency
in
neurology
at
the
University	B	University of Chicago Hospitals	University_of_Chicago_Medical_Center	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago_Medical_Center	000	000

It
was
in

late
1960s

was

,
that
he
became
interested
in
research
.

After
seeing
patients
during
the
day
,
he
had
time
to
catch
his
breath
in
the
evening
and
mull
over
the
amazing
research
underway
.

Researchers
had
discovered
that
measles
virus
in
the
brain
could
cause
chronic
encephalitis
,
and
that
Jakob-Creutzfeld
disease
--
a
“
degenerative
”
brain
disorder
in
humans
--
was
infectious
.

“
I
said
to
my
wife
,
‘
I
think
I
want
to
do
a
fellowship
in
infectious
diseases
,
’”
recalls
Gilden
,
who
was
32
at
the
time
.

“
She
looked
at
me
like
she
married
a
crazy
man
.
”

He
was
accepted
at
the
Johns
Hopkins
University
School
of
Hygiene
and
Public
Health
as
a
postdoctoral

Health	I	National Institutes of Health	National_Institutes_of_Health	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health	000	000
fellow
.

After
about
three
years
,
he
joined
the
faculty
at
University	B	University of Pennsylvania	University_of_Pennsylvania	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania	000	000
of	I	University of Pennsylvania	University_of_Pennsylvania	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania	000	000
Pennsylvania	I	University of Pennsylvania	University_of_Pennsylvania	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania	000	000
and
set
up
a
lab
at
the
Wistar
Institute
in
Philadelphia	B	Philadelphia	Philadelphia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia	000	000
to
find
the
virus
that
causes
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
.

He
worked
closely
with
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
patients
who
lived
in
a
chronic
care
facility
and
were
ravaged
by
the
disease
.

Gilden
asked
if
they
would
donate
their
brains
after
death
to
his
research
because
he
was
looking
for
the
cause
of
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
.

Sometimes
his
phone
rang
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
within
an
hour
Gilden
was
harvesting
brain
from
their
skulls
.

“
I
had
my
own
saw
,
”
he
says
.

He
studied
24
brains
over
eight
years
,
but
never
found
the
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
virus
.

So
,
he
turned
his
attention
to
varicella
zoster
virus
,
which
causes
chickenpox
in
children
and
shingles
in
adults
.

Nobody
had
ever
isolated
the
virus
,
and
if
he
could
prove
it
was
there
he
believed
he
could
use
the
same
technique
to
find
the
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
virus
.

He
tore
into
his
work
mapping
the
viral
genome
in
human
ganglia
along
the
entire
nervous
system
.

In
1983
,
he
proved
for
the
first
time
that
the
virus
was
latent
in
ganglia
and
“
reawakens
”
causing
shingles
.

The
shingles
virus
causes
pain
and
even
stroke
if
it
makes
its
way
to
the
brain
.

Gilden
found
several
other
diseases
caused
by
the
virus
,
such
as
zoster
sine
herpete
,
or
shingles
without
the
rash
.

His
discoveries
led
to
more
work
for
his
team
.

Gilden
left
the
University	B	University of Pennsylvania	University_of_Pennsylvania	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania	000	000
of	I	University of Pennsylvania	University_of_Pennsylvania	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania	000	000
Pennsylvania	I	University of Pennsylvania	University_of_Pennsylvania	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania	000	000
in
1985
to
become
professor
and
chairman
of
the
department
of
neurology
at
the
University
of
Colorado
School
of
Medicine
and
professor
of
microbiology
.

At
the
University
of
Colorado
,
15
members
of
Gilden
’s
team
are
working
on
varicella
zoster
virus
and
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
.

They
harvest
ganglia
collected
from
an
autopsy
room
.

“
We
go
there
every
day
,
”
Gilden
says
.

“
If
it
is
a
good
case
we
will
go
as
far
as
we
have
to
.

We
even
get
specimens
from
Japan	B	Japan	Japan	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan	000	000
.
”

MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
has
been
a
hard
case
to
crack
,
but
Gilden
seems
to
be
making
progress
.

The
common
theory
is
that
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
is
autoimmune
.

The
body
’s
immune
response
attacks
a
protein
that
is
normally
in
the
brain
.

The
attack
is
so
violent
and
persistent
that
the
brain
is
destroyed
in
the
process
.

“
We
do
n’t
think
that
is
the
case
at
all
,
”
Gilden
says
.

“
Even
now
we
have
evidence
that
it
is
not
autoimmune
.
”

He
argues
that
in
people
with
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
who
have
increased
amounts
of
an
antibody
called
immunoglobulin
G
(
IgG	B	IgG	Immunoglobulin_G	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G	000	000
)
,
in
their
brain
and
spinal
fluid
,
the
IgG	B	IgG	Immunoglobulin_G	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_G	000	000
is
directed
against
an
infectious
agent
,
but
nobody
is
quite
sure
at
what
agent
it
is
directed
.

He
and
his
team
are
looking
for
footprints
of
virus
in
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
.

“
We
are
writing
a
paper
showing
that
the
immune
response
in
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
is
not
against
a
self
(
auto
)
protein
,
”
he
says
.

While
he
is
busy
with
his
research
,
Gilden
,
who
is
married
and
has
three
adult
sons
,
skis
and
plays
the
violin
--
a
1779
Guadagnini
.

He
is
also
quick
to
tell

a
joke
.

Gilden
would
like
to
find
out
what
causes
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000
and
how
to
prevent
varicella
zoster
virus
from
reactivating
.

He
is
unfazed
by
the
fact
that
his
research
into
MS	B	MS	Multiple_sclerosis	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis	000	000

A4
Video
Converter
Description
:

With
a
very
easy
to
use
interface
A4
Video
Converter
can
convert
video
formats
,
extract
audio
from
video
files
and
extract
images
from
video
files
,
or
capture
video
clips
.

It
also
supports
cutting
video
files
,
extracting
audio
and
images
from
any
appointed
part
of
video
file
and
joining
several
video
files
into
a
single
video
file
or
audio
file
.

A4
Video
Converter
not
only
boasts
an
aesthetically
pleasing
design
,
but
its
logical
and
organized
structure
makes
it
a
no-brainer
to
use
.

Besides
converting
video
among
popular
video
formats
,
the
program
extracts
audio
into
a
wide
range
of
codecs
and
can
capture
movie
frames
as
individual
image
files
.

When
converting
files
,
you
can
specify
such
variables
as
frame
rate
,
compression
,
audio
format
,
and
bit
rate
.

Like
every
other
tool
in
A4
Video
Converter
,
the
cutting
feature
is
easy
to
use
,
letting
you
select
starting
and
ending
points
via
a
slider
and
providing
a
preview
window
for
reference
.

The
trial
version
does
place
a
watermark
on
your
output
files
,
but
that
's
much
less
restrictive
than
many
competing
apps
.

This
utility
makes
a
quality
pick
for
home
users
,
especially
those
who
need
powers
that
go
beyond
simple
conversions
.

Letter
from
the
Editor
(
July
,
1996
)

Its
hard
to
believe
it
but
two
years
have
come
and
gone
since
the

first
issue
of
the
Game
Cabinet
hit
the
Web
.

In
that
time
,
there
have

been
twenty-three
monthly
issues
-
I
missed
the
April
issue
of
this

year
-
with
over
500
articles
.

I
feel
like
I
should
thank
lots
of
people

individually
but
the
last
time
I
tried
that
I
left
out
poor
Stuart
!

So
a
special
thanks
to
Stuart
Dagger
and
,
of
course
,
Mike
Siggins

and
Catherine
Soubeyrand
who
have
been
great
about
helping
out
whenever

I
needed
them
.

All
of
the
Cabinet
Makers
have
added
their
own
bit
of

scrollwork
here
or
a
new
shelf
there
.

Without
them
,
the
whole
would
n't

have
been
as
exciting
.

I
hope
we
can
all
make
it
another
two
years
!

Thanks
,
again
,
folks
!

As
an
aside
,
Mike
Sanderson

brought
us
the
whizzy
birthday
cakes
appearing
on
this
month
's
cover
.

Thanks
,
Mike
!

By
the
way
,
Mike
hates
endless
loops
,
too
,
but
it
is
a

birthday
so
a
certain
amount
of
fuss
was
appropriate
.

The
German
Invasion
:
American
Phase

This
Summer
we
are
witnessing
the
beginning
of
a
German	B	German	Germany	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany	000	000
invasion
of
America	B	America	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
.

Mayfair	B	Mayfair	Mayfair	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayfair	000	000
has
released
a
line
of
five
new

German	B	German	Germany	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany	000	000
imports
,
including
many
Spiel	B	Spiel des Jahres	Spiel_des_Jahres	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiel_des_Jahres	000	000
des	I	Spiel des Jahres	Spiel_des_Jahres	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiel_des_Jahres	000	000
Jahres	I	Spiel des Jahres	Spiel_des_Jahres	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiel_des_Jahres	000	000
winners
from
the
past

few
years
.

Winning	B	Winning Moves	Winning_Moves	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Moves	000	000
Moves	I	Winning Moves	Winning_Moves	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Moves	000	000
has
released
Raj
,
an
American	B	American	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
edition
of
Hol
's

der
Geier
,
an
interesting
little
card
game
(
though
I
must
admit
that

I
would
be
tempted
to
use
the
bits
to
play
High
Society
,
instead
)
.

6
Nimmt
has
been
released
as
Take
6
.

And
there
are
more
to
follow
.

The
Mayfair	B	Mayfair	Mayfair	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayfair	000	000
series
looks
quite
good
.

I
could
quibble
about
some
of

the
production
choices
.

I
'm
not
a
huge
fan
of
their
use
of
photography

in
place
of
paintings
or
drawings
as
in
Settlers
of
Cattan
.

And
I
think

leaving
the
card
colors
off
of
the
board
for
Modern	B	Modern Art	Modern_art	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_art	000	000
Art	I	Modern Art	Modern_art	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_art	000	000
is
a
bit
of

a
game
play
faux
pax
.

But
the
simple
fact
is
that
all
of
the
games
in

the
new
line
are
produced
to
a
higher
standard
than
we
have
become

accustomed
to
here
in
the
States	B	States	U.S._state	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state	000	000
.

And
the
prices
have
been
kept
in

line
with
or
even
lower
than
those
we
are
accustomed
to
paying
.

Mayfair	B	Mayfair	Mayfair	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayfair	000	000

has
done
an
excellent
job
and
they
've
certainly
earned
the
point
position

on
all
subsequent
import
editions
.

Winning	B	Winning Moves	Winning_Moves	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Moves	000	000
Moves	I	Winning Moves	Winning_Moves	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_Moves	000	000
has
made
a
mixed
start
out
of
the
gate
.

Raj
and
Priceless

are
certainly
of
interest
.

But
the
rest
of
the
line
seems
to
be
marketed

at
the
Victorian
Parlour
Game
crowd
.

What
's
in
a
Name
?

Which
reminds
me
:
there
has
been
a
running
discussion
in
Sumo	B	Sumo	Sumo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo	000	000
as
to

what
term
should
be
used
to
refer
to
the
sorts
of
games
that
are
covered

in
The
Game
Cabinet
,
Sumo	B	Sumo	Sumo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo	000	000
,
and
The
Game
Report
.

Clearly
,
some
of
the
games

fall
into
the
category
of
Victorian
Parlor
Games
.

Taboo
,
TriBond
,
TalkSHOW	B	TalkSHOW	Talk_show	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show	000	000
,
and

friends
descend
from
that
tradition
.

But
most
of
the
games
are
fairly

new
and
original
both
in
form
and
substance
.

Collectable
card
games

along
with
the
works
of
Knizia	B	Knizia	Reiner_Knizia	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reiner_Knizia	000	000
,
Sackson
,
Teuber
,
and
others
define
a

new
genre
(
or
genres
)
of
games
for
which
we
have
no
easy
label
.

My
suggestion
(
boy
,
I
can
really
feel
'em
flappin
'
in
the
wind
now
,
boys
)
:

Cafe
Games
.

These
games
tend
to
be
short
in
duration
-
1
to
1.5
hours
tops
.

They
're
appearance
is
striking
and
,
ideally
,
even
beautiful
.

The
individual

components
are
of
high
quality
-
durable
cards
from
Belgium	B	Belgium	Belgium	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium	000	000
,
simple
pieces
made

of
wood
,
more
sculpted
pieces
made
of
bright
,
durable
plastic
,
boards
mounted

on
heavy
cardboard
with
waterproof
coatings
.

The
game
play
is
dynamic
and

engaging
with
all
of
the
players
active
as
much
of
the
time
as
possible
.

The
social
aspects
are
strong
as
players
interact
and
have
a
good
time
.

And
the
games
appeal
to
a
broad
range
of
people
-
not
just
the
fanboys

and
the
spielfreaks
.

The
Rumor
Monger

I
'm
curious
about
ElfenWars
,
an
obscure
Alan	B	Alan Moon	Alan_R._Moon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_R._Moon	000	000
Moon	I	Alan Moon	Alan_R._Moon	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_R._Moon	000	000
design
mentioned
in

this
month
's
Sumo	B	Sumo	Sumo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo	000	000
.

Anyone
know
anything
more
about
it
?

Apparently
copies

have
been
changing
hands
at
outrageous
prices
.

The
Ravensburger	B	Ravensburger	Ravensburger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensburger	000	000
/
FX	B	FX Schmid	Ravensburger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensburger	000	000
Schmid	I	FX Schmid	Ravensburger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensburger	000	000
merger
continues
.

Apparently
,
FX	B	FX Schmid	Ravensburger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensburger	000	000
Schmid	I	FX Schmid	Ravensburger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensburger	000	000
will
be

using
the
Ravensburger	B	Ravensburger	Ravensburger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensburger	000	000
production
facilities
for
boards
,
boxes
,
and
the

like
while
Ravensburger	B	Ravensburger	Ravensburger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensburger	000	000
will
be
using
FX	B	FX Schmid	Ravensburger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensburger	000	000
Schmid	I	FX Schmid	Ravensburger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensburger	000	000
's
card
production
.

So
we

can
look
for
even
higher
quality
editions
from
both
companies
!

The
plan

for
now
is
to
operate
both
design
groups
separately
.

This
seems
like
a

wise
decision
as
Ravensburger	B	Ravensburger	Ravensburger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensburger	000	000
is
strongest
in
children
's
games
while

FX	B	FX Schmid	Ravensburger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensburger	000	000
Schmid	I	FX Schmid	Ravensburger	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravensburger	000	000
is
strongest
with
adult
and
family
games
.

Inside
the
Cabinet

Do
n't
forget
to
check
out
Charles
Vasey
's
article
on

Chaos
Gaming
.

This
one
really

struck
a
chord
with
the
Sumo	B	Sumo	Sumo	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo	000	000
gaming
world
back
when
it
was
first

published
.

And
I
wonder
if
Mr
Siggins
should
n't
re-read
it
in
his

endless
quest
to
put
the
whole
Settlers	B	Settlers	Settler	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler	000	000
controversy
to
rest
...

Newcomer
Joe
Celko
fills
us
in
on
Chinese	B	Chinese	China	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China	000	000
dominoes
.

Joe
's
articles
launch
what
I
hope
will
grow
into
quite
a
complete

listing
of
domino
games
.

And
last
,
but
not

,
I

Nissan	B	Nissan	Nissan_Motor_Company	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Motor_Company	000	000

starting
to
sell
their

the

They
have
lithium

range

You
lease
the
battery
at
2-3
cents
a
mile

I
could
never

Absolutely
,

But
some
people
do
n't
like
the
look
of
the
vehicles
on
the
market
right
now
-
or
the
ones
due
to
reach
market
sooner
.

Or
,
if
you
just
want
to
be
different
,
you
know
that
there
's
at
least
no
chance
that
someone
will
take
your
own
converted
car
away
on
a
lease
buy-back
scheme
.

It
's
just
another
option
to
getting
an
EV	B	EV	Ford_Focus_Electric	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Focus_Electric	000	000
and
an
EV	B	EV	EVS_Broadcast_Equipment	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVS_Broadcast_Equipment	000	000
grin
.

How
you
get
there
is
up
to
the
indidvidual
.

Thanks
for
the

comments

guys
.

I
suspect
both
Adam
and
John
would
love
to
come
back
to
do
a
future
show
.

I
plan
to
do
one
soon
about
plug
in
hybrids
and
DIY	B	DIY	Do_it_yourself	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself	000	000
stuff
there
...
While
it
's
not
exactly
a
full
electric
vehicle
some
of
the
stuff
carries
over
...

The
Enfield
was
not
created
by
the
same
company
as
made
the
motorbikes
-
at
least
,
I
do
n't
THINK
they
did
.

Nikki

I
have
to
third
the
kudos
to
your
program
.

I
liked
the
diy
program
and
I
think
as
much
is
it
would
be
nice
to
plunk
money
down
on
the
Chevy	B	Chevy Volt	Chevrolet_Volt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt	000	000
Volt	I	Chevy Volt	Chevrolet_Volt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt	000	000
or
the
Ford	B	Ford Focus EV	Ford_Focus_Electric	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Focus_Electric	000	000
Focus	I	Ford Focus EV	Ford_Focus_Electric	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Focus_Electric	000	000
EV	I	Ford Focus EV	Ford_Focus_Electric	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Focus_Electric	000	000
I
'm
not
sure
that
the
Volt	B	Volt	Chevrolet_Volt	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt	000	000
is
something
I
can
afford
and
the
Ford	B	Ford Focus	Ford_Focus_Electric	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Focus_Electric	000	000
Focus	I	Ford Focus	Ford_Focus_Electric	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Focus_Electric	000	000
is
a
way
for
Ford	B	Ford	Ford_Motor_Company	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company	000	000
to
reach
the
new
EPA	B	EPA	United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency	000	000
mileage
standards
for
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
fleet
while
still
holding
onto
the
huge
Ford
Expeditions
and
the
like
.

If
Ford	B	Ford	Ford_Motor_Company	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company	000	000
can
build
just
enough
EVs	B	EVs	EVS_Broadcast_Equipment	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVS_Broadcast_Equipment	000	000
to
tip
the
balance
in
its
favor
it
can
continue
with
business
as
usual
.

Ford	B	Ford	Ford_Motor_Company	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company	000	000
does
n't
even
have
to
sell
them
to
the
public
.

They
can
sell
them
only
to
commercial
car
fleet
purchasers
and
exclude
the
general
public
.

No
wonder
they
do
n't
want
any
bail
out
money
.

What
car
company
wants
its
CEO
fired
and
then
to
be
told
that
it
can
no
longer
make
anymore
Fuel
Sucking
Pigs
or
FSPs
as
we
call
them
here
.

So
I
was
gratified
to
hear
John
"
Plasmaboy
"
Wayland
talk
about
and
advocate
common
sense
strategies
for
converting
to
electric
with
out
the
appeal
to
magic
batteries
or
free
energy
ponzie
schemes
to
power
the
cars
.

One
thing
I
would
probably
beg
to
differ
with
John
on
though
is
that
he
said
that
modern
cars
would
be
more
difficult
to
convert
and
he
discouraged
it
.

I
think
this
is
wrong
for
three
reasons
.

First
,
newer
cars
are
safer
cars
.

Older
cars
like
the
Volkswagen	B	Volkswagen Rabbit	Volkswagen_Golf	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf	000	000
Rabbit	I	Volkswagen Rabbit	Volkswagen_Golf	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf	000	000
of
the
1980s
have
no
airbags
,
reinforced
steel
doors
or
headrests
that
absorb
whiplash
and
are
therefore
death
traps
in
a
car
accident
.

It
's
not
a
trivial
matter
here
in
the
US	B	US	United_States	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States	000	000
because
upwards
of
32,000
people
die
per
year
in
accidents
.

Part
of
it
is
undoubtedly
due
to
the
driving
while
cellular
syndrome
which
is
a
pox
on
the
nation
.

Second
,
newer
cars
do
not
have
to
be
harder
to
convert
.

I
saw
a
website
of
a
beautifully
converted
electric
Yaris
that
I
drooled
over
.

It
was
so
well
done
it
looked
factory
.

The
Yaris
came
out
around
'06
so
it
has
all
the
CANBUS
paraphernalia
in
it
and
yet
it
was
converted
successfully
with
the
best
parts
availably
like
a
Netgain
Warp
9
series
DC
motor
,
a
1000
amp
Cafe
Electric
Zilla
controller
and
Exide
blue
maintenance
free
batteries
.

The
car
was
brand
new
when
it
was
converted
so
it
can
be
done
if
you
choose
a
car
without
all
the
bells
,
whistles
and
goo-gahs
onboard
.

A
Yaris
fits
the
bill
.

http://www.go-ev.com/Mark_Dutko_Album_files/

Third
,
with
the
exception
of
the
Chevy	B	Chevy S-10	Chevrolet_S-10	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_S-10	000	000
S-10	I	Chevy S-10	Chevrolet_S-10	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_S-10	000	000
which
is
still
an
excellent
conversion
choice
even
if
GM	B	GM	General_Motors	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors	000	000
goes
into
the
drink
,
most
of
the
older
cars
that
John
talks
about
converting
like
the
Rabbit
of
the
'80s
will
undoubtedly
have
difficulty
obtaining
replacement
parts
for
things
like
CV	B	CV	Curriculum_vitae	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae	000	000
joints
,
tie
rods
,
springs
,
tail
light
lenses
,
seats
,
etc.
.

So
when
choosing
a
car
its
important
to
choose
one
that
you
can
get
replacement
parts
for
or
you
're
in
for
a
world
of
hurt
like
the
president
of
our
EV	B	EV	EVS_Broadcast_Equipment	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVS_Broadcast_Equipment	000	000
club
was
until
he
found
a
practically
pristine

for
his
factory
converted
Horizon	B	Horizon	Dodge_Omni	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Omni	000	000
called
the
Jet
Electrica
007
.

There
was
just
one
other
minor
point
.

I
have
both
books
,
"
Convert
It
"
by
Michael
Brown
and
the
original
"
Build
Your
Own
Electric
Vehicle
"
book
by
Bob
Brant
and
I
liked
the
Bob
Brant
book
more
because
it
explains
the
advantages
of
each
type
of
battery
and
electric
motor
in
detail
.

It
also
places
great
emphasis
on
the
proper
choice
of
vehicle
to
convert
based
on
vehicle
curb
weight
,
wind
drag
coefficient
and
capacitiy
for
storing
batteries
.

But
then
I
'm
a
ham
radio
operator
so
I
think
now
you
know
why
I
like
Brant
's
book
more
.

But
John
has
a
valid
point
.

Michael
Brown
's
book
is
an
easier
read
and
I
feel
that
most
people
who
read
the
book
who
have
also
done
shade
tree
mechanic
work
,
like
replacing
a
steering
rack
arm
or
replacing
a
water
pump
,
can
do
this
.

Ooops
!

I
was
wrong
on
the
availability
of
parts
for
the
Volkswagen	B	Volkswagen Rabbit	Volkswagen_Golf	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf	000	000
Rabbit	I	Volkswagen Rabbit	Volkswagen_Golf	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf	000	000
.

It
turns
out
the
Rabbit	B	Rabbit	Rabbit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit	000	000
was
much
loved
,
(
by
everyone
but
me
but
only
because
I
had
to
fix
my
girlfriend
's
,
now
my
wifes
old
Rabbit
ICE
engine
when
it
broke
otherwise
its
a
fun
car
)
and
so
a
cottage
industry
has
evolved
around
the
Rabbit
.

Great
show
.

It
is
because
of
guys
like
John
Wayland
,
KiwiEv
,
and
many
others
that
have
done
conversions
that
inspired
me
and
I
am
sure
many
others
to
do
there
conversions
.

Because
it
seems
like
it
takes
forever
for
the
manufactures
to
catch
up
with
private
garages
it
is
people
like
this
that
keep
the
fire
going
for
ev
's
.

Also
on
the
subject
of
Morris
Minors
.

We
also
had
the
Hillman
's
sold
here
in
the
U.S.

I
had
a
1959
Hillman
Husky
when
I
was
a
teenager
and
I
sure
wish
I
still
had
it
.

It
would
have
made
a
really
fun
sleeper
to
take
to
the
races
IMHO
.

It
was
very
similar
to
the
Morris
Minor
.

I
am
glad
to
rub
it
in
but
because
I
am
an
Oregonian
I
will
get
to
see
the
White
Zombie
run
the
July
at
Portland
International
Raceway
.

Woo
Hoo

Anyways
great
show
keep
up
the
good
work

,
home
of
Conde
Nast
Publishing
,
where
all
the
editorial
offices
for
those
big
glossy
magazines
are
located
.

It
was
from
a
production
assistant
at
Allure
Magazine
,
asking
how
they
could
get
in
touch
with
two
of
my
team
riders
,
the
beautiful
and
talented
twins
Sierra	B	Sierra	Sierra_Entertainment	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment	000	000
and
Hailey
Partridge
.

One
thing
led
to
another
and
within
a
few
weeks
the
girls
were
flown
down
to
a
shoot
on
the
beach
in
Southern	B	Southern California	Southern_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California	000	000
California	I	Southern California	Southern_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California	000	000
to
do
a
piece
on
Surfing
Beauties
.

The
twins
on
the
Allure
Surfing
Beauties
set
with
Roxy	B	Roxy	Roxy_(clothing)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxy_(clothing)	000	000
pro
surfer
Kassia
Meador
and
the
other
models
.

It
was
not
their
first
time
modeling
,
they
’ve
been
modeling
for
Betty
Belts
,
Hobie	B	Hobie	Hobie_cat	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobie_cat	000	000
and
O'Neill	B	O'Neill	O'Neill_(brand)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Neill_(brand)	000	000

Cruz	I	Santa Cruz	Santa_Cruz,_California	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz,_California	000	000
.

But
my
little
company
,
Betty
Belts
,
was
the
first
sponsor
to
bring
them
into
the
public
eye
and
really
help
get
their
careers
taking
off
.

The
contribution
of
my
absurdly
talented
husband-to-be
,
photographer
David
Pu’u
is
a
key
factor
.

A
former
pro
surfer
himself
,
he
has
been
very
supportive
of
my
team
riders
and
women
’s
surfing
.

See
David
’s
work
and
more
of
the
girls
on
my
website
www.bettybelts.com
.

Hailey
Partridge
,
a
surfing
beauty
ready
for
a
camera
.

I
asked
Sierra
and
Hailey
about
their
Allure
experience
and
here
’s
what
they
had
to
say
along
with
some
snapshots
they
took
from
the
day
.

What
you
enjoyed
most
?

Hailey
:
The
shoot
with
Allure
was
an
amazing
experience
that
I
was
very
fortunate
to
have
experienced
.

What
I
enjoyed
most
about
the
shoot
was
what
Sierra
and
I
called
“
the
star
treatment
”
.

We
were
picked
up
from
the
airport
in
an
Escalade
,
we
stayed
at
the
Ritz
Carlton
(
and
got
to
order
lots
of
room
service
!
)

,
we
got
manicures
and
pedicures
from
a
professional
manicurist
who
does
Hollywood	B	Hollywood	Hollywood	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood	000	000
stars
’
nails
and
our
hair
styled
by
a
hair
stylist
flown
all
the
way
from
London	B	London	London	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London	000	000
.

They
had
two
huge
trailers
for
us
to
relax
in
and
they
delivered
us
catered
breakfast
and
lunch
.

Overall
,
it
was
an
amazing
experience
,
everything
they
did
for
us
and
the
other
models
was
a
little
extravagant
but
I
was
n’t
complaining
!

I
also
really
enjoyed
getting
to
meet
Kassia
Meador
(
Roxy	B	Roxy	Roxy_(clothing)	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roxy_(clothing)	000	000
surfer
)
as
well
as
the
other
two
models
,
Katarina
Lyerly
and
Megan
Abrigo
,
they
were
all
so
friendly
and
were
very
genuine
and
down-to-earth
girls
.

the
“
star
treatment
”
in
the
hair
and
makeup

rubdown
with
body
oil
.

What
you
learned
?

Sierra	B	Sierra	Sierra_Entertainment	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment	000	000
:
I
learned
that
there
is
so
much
work
that
goes
into
a
magazine
.

This
was
just
one
article
and
it
took
a
month
to
plan
and
about
30
people
behind
the
scenes
to
bring
it
all
together
.

Your
favorite
shoot
so
far
?

Hailey
:
My
favorite
shoot
was
the
2007
Hobie	B	Hobie	Hobie_cat	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobie_cat	000	000
swimwear
shoot
in
Kona	B	Kona	Kona_District,_Hawaii	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kona_District,_Hawaii	000	000
last
November
with
David
Pu’u
.

David
is
the
most
fun
photographer
to
work
with
and
the
week
long
shoot
was
an
incredible
experience
.

We
got
to
swim
with
dolphins
(
totally
unplanned
)
and
it
was
amazing
.

Sierra	B	Sierra	Sierra_Entertainment	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment	000	000
:
My
favorite
shoots
are
the
Hobie	B	Hobie	Hobie_cat	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobie_cat	000	000
shoots
with
David
(
Pu’u
)
because
every
day
is
new
and
exciting
,
and
I
’ve
gotten
to
experience
some
things
that
I
would
’ve
never
been
able
to
do
like
swimming
with
wild
dolphins
and
catching
waves
in
an
outrigger
.

This
is
one
of
the
photos
from
the
Hobie	B	Hobie	Hobie_cat	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobie_cat	000	000
shoot

Higher
education
:
Does
obtaining
an
advanced
degree
help
protect
against
risky
behavior
?

Many
societies
regard
higher
education
as
a
protectorate
against
addiction
.

Such
culturally
developed
beliefs
can
create
biases
that
preclude
opportunities
for
early
detection
of
problems
and
consequently
early
intervention
.

In
this
issue
of
Addiction	B	Addiction	Addiction	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction	000	000
and
the
Humanities
,
we
review
evidence
of
substance-related
problems
among
the
highly
educated
.

Although
education
tends
to
decrease
the
likelihood
of
substance-related
addiction
(

)
,
the
highly
educated
are
not
immune
to
developing
substance
use
problems
.

Researchers
surveyed
a
highly
educated
workforce
(
Matano
,
Wanat
,
Westrup
,
Koopman
,
&
Whistsell
,
2002
)
to
investigate
the
prevalence
of
risky
substance
use
behaviors
among
a
more
educated
workforce
.

Matano
et
al.
(
2002
)
randomly
selected
10
%
(
N
=
857
)
of
employees
to
receive
surveys
regarding
their
substance
use
behaviors
during
the
previous
12
months
.

Of
these
eligible
employees
,
504
sent
back
completed
surveys
.

Respondents
were
62.8
%
female
and
ranged
in
age
from
21
to
78
(
M
=
43.8
)
.

Eighty
one
percent
of
the
sample
earned
a
bachelor
’s
degree
or
higher
and
3
%
earned
a
high
school
diploma
or
less
.

Table
1
summarizes
the
survey
results
.

The
results
reveal
that
alcohol
and
licit
drug
use
was
more
prevalent
than
illicit
substance
use
among
this
sample
.

A
significant
number
of
employees
however
,
reported
illicit
drug
use
during
the
past
year
.

Based
on
responses
to
the
CAGE	B	CAGE	CAGE_questionnaire	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAGE_questionnaire	000	000
(
Ewing
,
1984
)
,
12
%
qualified
for
“
likely
to
have
lifetime
alcohol
dependence
.
”

Responses
to
the
AUDIT	B	AUDIT	Audit	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit	000	000
(
Bush	B	Bush	George_W._Bush	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush	000	000
,
Kivlahan
,
Mcdonnell
,
Fihn
,
&
Bradley	B	Bradley	Bradley_University	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_University	000	000
,
1998
)
indicated
that
5
%
had
a
“
high
likelihood
of
alcohol
abuse
.
”

In
addition
,
3
%
claimed
that
their
alcohol
consumption
caused
injury
to
someone
else
.

Despite
these
results
only
a
handful
of
employees
reported
receiving
any
substance
abuse
treatment
over
the
last
year
.

Table
1
.

Past
year
substance
use
among
employees
(
N
=
504
)

There
are
several
limitations
to
this
study
.

For
example
,
the
60
%
response
rate
might
result
in
substance
use
differences
between
those
that
completed
and
those
that
did
not
complete
the
survey
.

In
addition
,
this
survey
was
conducted
in
1999
,
and
it
is
possible
that
substance
use
behaviors
among
highly
educated
employees
have
changed
since
then
.

Finally
,
substance
use
might
be
a
more
sensitive
topic
for
the
highly
educated
,
perhaps
biasing
the
self-report
in
the
direction
of
underreporting
.

Despite
constraints
that
might
limit
the
extent
of
reported
substance
use
and
related
problems
,
this
study
confirms
that
substance
use
and
abuse
is
not
an
issue
reserved
only
for
less
educated
individuals
.

There
is
a
need
for
employee
prevention
and
intervention
programs
in
work
forces
populated
by
the
highly
educated
.

Assuming
that
educated
individuals
are
immune
to
substance
use
problems
might
diminish
their
chances
of
getting
the
help
they
need
.

Books
&
Technology
Roundup

Book
publishers
have
been
on
our
minds
since
our
post
on
25
Lessons
Publishers
Can
Teach
Startups
.

In
particular
because
Digital
Book
World
took
place
,
then
O’Reilly
Tools
of
Change
,
plus
the
National
Book
Count
data
was
released
and
our
client
Canadian
Bookshelf
announced
today
that
Amazon.ca
will
be
its
lead
sponsor
for
2012
and
they
are
rebranding
as
The
49th
Shelf
.

Here
’s
the
big
news
in
books
.

Digital
Book
World
Conference

Digital
Book
World
keeps
a
running
commentary
on
their
blog
of
insights
into
publishing
in
the
21st
century
.

Following
the
conference
,
attendees
posted
a
number
of
summaries
of
the
sessions
and
keynotes
on
various
sites
.

Here
are
the
standout
factoids
and
anecdotes
in
my
mind
.

Publisher
optimism
about
the
digital
evolution
has
lessened
over
the
past
year
.

72
%
of
publishers
feel
they
can
be
competitive
in
the
new
digital
market
(
down
83
%
from
last
year
)
.

Ebook
sales
increased
17
%
in
2011
.

For
top
publishers
,
15
%
of
their
book
sales
were
from
digital
in
2011
.

There
is
a
lot
of
variation
across
publisher
and
dependent
on
the
genre
of
books
published
.

Consumer
preference
for
reading
ebooks
shows
35
%
prefer
dedicated
e-readers
(
Kindle	B	Kindle	Amazon_Kindle	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle	000	000
)
,
31
%
tablets
(
iPad	B	iPad	IPad	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad	000	000

,
and
30
%

,
NookColor	B	NookColor	Nook_Color	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nook_Color	000	000

)
.

Also
of
note
,
Sourcebooks
announced
their
experimentation
with
an
agile
publishing
model
.

Getting
to
+1
:
A
Social
Approach
to
Winning
Support
for
Search
Marketing

Last
night
I
presented
to
the
SEMPO
Vancouver
meetup
group
on
the
different
perspectives
of
generalists
and
specialists
when
it
comes
to
Search	B	Search Marketing	Search_engine_marketing	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_marketing	000	000
Marketing	I	Search Marketing	Search_engine_marketing	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_marketing	000	000
.

In
summary
,
marketing
generalists
are
under
a
ton
of
pressure
to
understand
and
create
effective
marketing
strategies
that
address
the
growth
of
marketing
channels
and
device
choices
,
on
top
of
dealing
with
the
explosion
of
marketing
data
and
financial
constraints
.

Search
marketing
specialists
can
play
a
key
strategic
role
in
answering
business
questions
like
“
how
should
I
allocate
budget
among
each
marketing
channel
,
”
“
how
can
I
get
more
leads
,
”
and
“
what
can
I
do
to
get
more
sales
?
”

But
specialists
need
to
understand
the
social
approach
to
winning
support
from
generalists
.

This
presentation
offers
tips
for
Search
Specialists
looking
to
gain
support
from
clients
,
managers
,
executives
and
other
generalists
.

Sun	I	Vancouver Sun	The_Vancouver_Sun	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vancouver_Sun	000	000
recently
published
an
article
by
Sean
Cranbury
that
highlights
Monique
Trottier
’s
presentation
at
BNC
Technology
Forum
2011
.

Tech
Forum
is
an
annual
event
that
showcases
experts
and
visionaries
from
the
international
publishing
and
bookselling
scene
.

This
year
’s
focus
was
on
practical
insights
on
the
digital
space
and
Monique
presented
on
measuring
the
success
of
your
online
marketing
campaigns
.

Organized
by
BookNet
’s
Samantha
Francis
,
the
conference
opened
with
keynote
speaker
Mitch	B	Mitch Joel	Mitch_Joel	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Joel	000	000
Joel	I	Mitch Joel	Mitch_Joel	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Joel	000	000

,
Colin
Robinson
of
Or
Books
,
and
Alex
Jansen
of
Pop
Sandbox
.

See
the
complete
list
of
speakers
.

In
a
summary
of
the
day
,
the
Vancouver	B	Vancouver Sun	The_Vancouver_Sun	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vancouver_Sun	000	000
Sun	I	Vancouver Sun	The_Vancouver_Sun	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vancouver_Sun	000	000
article
mentions
Monique
’s
presentation
,
titled
“
Beyond
Fans
and
Followers	B	Followers	Followers	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Followers	000	000
,
Measuring
Your
Online
Marketing
Campaigns
.
”

[
Trottier
]
proceeded
to
demonstrate
how
tools
like
Google	B	Google Analytics	Google_Analytics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics	000	000
Analytics	I	Google Analytics	Google_Analytics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics	000	000
can
be
used
to
measure
the
success
of
online
marketing
campaigns
.

The
twitter
hashtag
#TechForum11
was
tending
at
this
time
and
many
of
the
tweets
that
emerged
from
Monique
’s
session
lauded
her
generous
attention
to
detail
.

Jack
Illingworth
,
Executive
Director
of
Literary
Press
Group
Canada	B	Canada	Canada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada	000	000
tweeted
:
“
[
Monique
]
has
said
more
in
9
minutes
that
most
do
in
an
hour
”
while
freelance
editor
Laura
Godrey
summed
up
the
general
mood
by
tweeting
“
@somisguided
is
totally
#crushingit
at
#techforum11
.

I
need
to
learn
to
use
Google	B	Google Analytics	Google_Analytics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics	000	000
Analytics	I	Google Analytics	Google_Analytics	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics	000	000
...
”

It
was
the
kind
of
presentation
that
seeks
to
be
the
example
that
others
will
follow
in
terms
of
commitment
,
content
and
practical
value
for
the
audience
and
it
was
arguably
the
best
session
of
the
day
.

Thank
you
to
Sean
Cranbury
for
the
very
flattering
representation
of
the
session
!

posted
an
article
on
how

Vancouver
’s
book
scene
is
being
reshaped
by
online
communities
.

The
article
looks
at
how
the
web
is
changing
the
publishing
industry
and
readers
’
relationship
to
books
.

Vancouver
,
in
particular
,
is
playing
a
role
in
changing
the
Canadian	B	Canadian	Canada	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada	000	000
publishing
landscape
with
events
like
the
Vancouver
Book
Club
,
the
W2
Real
Vancouver
Writers
’
&
Culture
Series
and
BookCamp
Vancouver
.

Monique
,
who
the
article
states
,
“
has
played
an
instrumental
role
in
the
digital
growth
of
Canada
’s
publishing
industry
”
was
interviewed
for
the
article
:

When
Trottier
started
at
Raincoast
,
she
was
one
of
only
a
handful
of
people
in
publishing
who
worked
online
.

“
Even
at
that
stage
,
it
was
clear
that
the
hierarchy
of
conversation
about
books
was
collapsing
,
”
Trottier
told
the
Straight	B	Straight	The_Georgia_Straight	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Georgia_Straight	000	000
at
a
Kitsilano	B	Kitsilano	Kitsilano	en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsilano	000	000
coffee
shop
.

Publishers
--
and
only
publishers
--
used
to
engage
with
media
and
booksellers
,
and
then
media
and
booksellers
would
communicate
with
retail
buyers
and
the
public
.

“
The
web
has
really
collapsed
that
,
”
Trottier
said
.

“
The
conversation
happens
between
readers
and
between
writers
,
and
then
directly
between
readers
and
writers
and
publishers
.
”

While
social
media
allow
publishers
to
listen
more
closely
to
their
markets
,
Trottier
acknowledges
that
they
’re
not
the
silver
bullet
that
will
save
the
industry
.

“
Publishers
are
going
to
save
themselves
when
they
figure
out
what
their
new
business
model
is
,
”
she
said
.
